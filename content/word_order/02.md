# word_order Article

The normal sentence structure in Biblical Hebrew is: the verb, in first position; the subject, in second position; the object, in third position.  Other grammatical elements such as adjectives, adverbs, prepositional phrases, discourse particles, etc. can be inserted at various points within that general sentence structure according to the conventions of the language.  In the majority of cases, variations in word order do not critically affect the meaning of individual sentences.  However, in some instances a grammatical element (most especially the subject) placed before the verb has implications for the general structure and/or chunking of a narrative. In these cases, the context must determine whether this indicates a new narrative or section of text (or not), or whether this indicates a break in the narrative (or not).

It is extremely important to remember that, most of the time, grammatical elements which are placed before the verb usually do not have any special significance for the meaning of the sentence.  It is only in certain instances where the word order of grammatical elements can indicate to the reader elements of narrative structuring.  As a general rule, these specific guidelines should not be applied to Hebrew poetry.

#### Introducing a new narrative or section of text

Sometimes the subject of a sentence is placed before the verb in order to initiate a new narrative, or a new section of a narrative.  Not all narratives begin this way in Biblical Hebrew; sometimes a new narrative begins with a sequential prefix conjugation verb (see 1 Sam 1:1).  

* JOB 1:1



* 2KI 3:


A subject placed before the verb can also indicate a new section of text, or a continuation after there has been a break in the narrative.

* 2SA 18:19
** וַאֲחִימַ֤עַץ בֶּן־צָדוֹק֙ אָמַ֔ר

#### Indicating a break in the narrative

It is most often the case that a grammatical element that has been placed in front of the verb does not indicate a break in the narrative.  Rather, it has been placed there for other reasons that do not apply to narrative structuring.

* GEN 1:4
** 

* 2KI 3:


However, sometimes a grammatical element (usually the subject) placed before the verb can indicate a break in the narrative action in order to provide the reader with some extra information about the story being told.  Usually, these instances will be clearly discerned from the context of the story.

* 2KI 3:??



* 2SA 18:18
