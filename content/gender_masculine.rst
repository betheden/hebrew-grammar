Gender Masculine
================

Summary
-------

In Biblical Hebrew, all :ref:`noun`, finite :ref:`adjective`,
:ref:`pronoun` :ref:`suffix_pronominal`,
and some :ref:`particle`
are grammatically marked for gender. This gender marking can be
:ref:`gender_feminine`, :ref:`gender_common`, or :ref:`gender_both`.

Article
-------

In Biblical Hebrew, every :ref:`noun`
is classified according to gender, either masculine or
:ref:`gender_feminine` or :ref:`gender_both`.
Many other words change the way they look when they refer to that noun.
:ref:`adjective`
agree with the gender of the noun they refer to. The gender of a :ref:`verb-finite-verbs`
agrees with its subject. All references to male persons in Biblical
Hebrew are grammatically marked as masculine. However, other things
besides people can also be classified as grammatically-masculine. For
example, abstract ideas are often expressed with a masculine
:ref:`number_plural` form.

Form
----

Masculine :ref:`number_singular` :ref:`noun` and :ref:`adjective`
have no special endings; they are the standard dictionary form.
Masculine :ref:`number_dual`
nouns end in pataq-yod-hireq-final mem, as in צָהֳרַיִם (noon).
Masculine :ref:`number_plural`
nouns and adjectives usually end in hireq-yod-final mem, as in אֲנָשִׁים
(men).

Paradigm
~~~~~~~~

Besides nouns, a masculine word can be recognized by a variety of
changes to the form. These changes differ greatly from each other and
are hard to sum up in a simple, helpful way. This paradigm shows a
sample of the kinds of changes that signal a masculine form.
