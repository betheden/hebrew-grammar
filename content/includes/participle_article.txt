Participles in Biblical Hebrew are non-finite verbal forms that can change form based on :ref:`stem`
formations (like verbs), person and gender (like both 
:ref:`adjective`\s and :ref:`noun`\s),
and state (like nouns, i.e.
:ref:`state_absolute` or the :ref:`state_construct`).
Participles are very flexible in their grammatical use and can function
as a verbal complement, :ref:`verb-finite-verbs`, an :ref:`adjective`,
or a :ref:`noun`.  In most cases, the context will clearly show how the 
participle is being used in the sentence. The meaning of a participle is 
usually clear, even in cases where its specific grammatical function cannot 
be determined precisely.
