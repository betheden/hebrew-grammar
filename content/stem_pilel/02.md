The Pilel stem is a variation of the [Piel stem](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_piel/02.md) and has potential to express the same range of verbal action.  The Pilel stem is formed from the Piel stem by dropping the 2nd radical and repeating the 3rd radical.  It is an extremely rare verbal form in Biblical Hebrew. Many of the verbs in the Pilel stem in the Hebrew Bible are from the root נָאָה ("to be fitting, desirable"). It is recommended to *always* consult a dictionary or lexicon for the precise nuance of any verb in the Pilel stem.
