# gender_both Article
I'm not sure how this is different from "gender_common".  

***[Editorial note (Joel): There are some nouns in Biblical Hebrew that appear in both masculine and feminine forms.  The Hebrew words for "light" (אוֹר) and "luminary" (מָאוֹר) are both good examples.  In Gen. 1:3-5, the word ??? is masculine; but in Esther 8:18, the word ??? is feminine.  In Gen. 1:14-18, the word ???? is feminine; but in Ezek 32:7-8, the word ???? is feminine.  So "gender common" means that the word has potential to refer to either a masculine or feminine referent (and thus take masculine or feminine grammatical marking).  But "gender both" means that one and the same object is both "grammatically masculine" and "grammatically feminine" with in the Biblical Hebrew text.  They are different phenomena, and should be parsed differently.]***
