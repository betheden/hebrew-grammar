# verb_cohortative Article
The cohortative form looks very similar to an imperfect form but functions in the sentence more like an imperative.  Cohortative verbs appear only in 1st person forms.  [Similarly, imperatives appear only in 2nd person forms, and jussives usually appear in 3rd person forms.]  A cohortative verb does not carry the full force of a command ("We *must* do this!"), but it conveys a stronger meaning than a simple suggestion or statement of possibilty ("We *could* do this.").  The meaning is somewhere in the middle.  In English, a cohortative is often translated with a helping verb such as "let" or "want" or "will," depending on the context (*"Let us do this!"* or *"I want to do this!"*).  Thus, the cohortative verb functions as an indirect command; the reader must examine the context to determine the strength of desirability being expressed in each specific instance.

***[Editorial note: How are verbs being tagged where the imperfect form is functioning cohortatively?  Are they being tagged as "cohortative" or "imperfect"?  This makes a difference in how this article should be written.  I have written this as if they are tagged as "imperfect."  But if they are tagged as cohortative, then this section should be slightly altered.]***

The negation particle אַל is always used to express a negative cohortative in Biblical Hebrew, never לֹא.  Thus, the use of the particle אַל with a cohortative does not reflect any specific nuance of meaning, as it does with certain imperfect and jussive forms.


The cohortative form can indicate any of the following kinds of actions:
