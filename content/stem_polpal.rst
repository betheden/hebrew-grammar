The Polpal :ref:`stem<stem>` is a variation of the :ref:`Pual<stem_pual>`
and expresses the :ref:`passive<stem-voice-passive>` voice of the verbal action of the :ref:`Pilpel<stem_pilpel>` stem.
The Polpal stem is formed from the Pual by dropping the 2nd radical and
repeating the 1st and 3rd radicals (with a vowel change), thus making a
verb that appears to have 4 consonants. It is an extremely :ref:`rare stem formation<stem-uncommon>`
in Biblical Hebrew.
