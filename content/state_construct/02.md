# state_construct Article
Several construct nouns can be together to form a construct chain. The last of those is in the absolute state, however.

Construct nouns do not take definite articles. But they are definite if the last word of the chain is definite. 

Adjectives and demonstratives normally follow the construct chain rather than interrupting it. 

## Indefinite

* EXO 15:3

    * אִ֣ישׁ מִלְחָמָ֑ה 

    * A warrior (literally, A man of war)

## Definite

* JOS 4:9

    * אֲר֣וֹן הַבְּרִ֑ית 

    * The ark of the covenant

    * אֲר֣וֹן is indefinite by itself. But it is definite because it is in a construct chain with the definite  הַבְּרִ֑ית.

* 1SA 20:27 

    * בֵּ֣ן לְיִשַׁי֮ 

    * the son of Jesse

    * Because names are definite, words in construct chains with them are also definite
