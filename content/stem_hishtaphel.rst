The Hishtaphel is a :ref:`rare stem formation<stem-uncommon>`
that is unrelated to any other :ref:`stem<stem>`. Many scholars believe this stem is derived from Ugaritic and is similar to the
:ref:`Hiphil<stem_hiphil>`, expressing :ref:`causative<stem-action-causative>` action in :ref:`active<stem-voice-active>` voice. 
However, In Biblical Hebrew this stem is used almost exclusively with the common verb חוי / חוה, meaning
"to prostrate oneself" (simple action with reflexive voice) or "to worship" (simple action with active voice).
