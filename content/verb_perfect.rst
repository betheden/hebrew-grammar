Verb Perfect
============

Summary
-------

A verb with suffix conjugation communicates perfect or perfective aspect, and so is used normally to indicate a completed
action, usually in the past. However, the suffix
conjugation can also be used to describe other kinds of actions.

In Biblical Hebrew a Suffix Conjugation
:ref:`verb`
communicates perfect or perfective aspect, and is normally used to describe actions that have occurred in the past or
actions that are seen as completed (even in present or future time). However,
the Suffix Conjugation is also used to describe a variety of other kinds
of actions. Thus, for tense-prominent languages, a Suffix Conjugation verb has the potential to be
translated with the past tense, the present tense, or even the future
tense. The context must determine the proper meaning for each instance
of a Suffix Conjugation verb.

When the
:ref:`conjunction`
*waw* (וְ "and") is added to the Suffix Conjugation as a prefix, this
can indicate either the :ref:`verb_perfect-suffix-conjugation-copulative`
or the :ref:`verb_sequential_perfect`.
The meaning of the verb is different in either case, and the context
must be carefully considered to determine if it is a suffix conjugation
copulative verb or a Sequential Suffix Conjugation verb.

Function
--------

The Suffix Conjugation can indicate any of the following kinds of
actions:

Completed actions in past time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Suffix Conjugation can be translated as simple past action, present
perfect (= completed) action ("he has done"), or past perfect action
("he had done").

.. csv-table:: Example: JER 43:7 — Suffix Conjugation translated as simple past

  כִּ֛י לֹ֥א **שָׁמְע֖וּ** בְּק֣וֹל יְהוָ֑ה
  ki lo **shom'u** beqol yehwah
  for not **they-listened** to-voice-of Yahweh.
  because **they** did not **listen** to Yahweh's voice.

.. csv-table:: Example: JER 43:10 — Suffix Conjugation translated as present perfect

  מִמַּ֛עַל לָאֲבָנִ֥ים הָאֵ֖לֶּה אֲשֶׁ֣ר טָמָ֑נְתִּי
  mimma'al la'avanim ha'elleh 'asher **tamanti**
  from-over to-the-stones the-these that **you-buried**.
  over these stones that **you have buried**.

.. csv-table:: Example: JER 43:5 — Suffix Conjugation translated as past perfect

  כָּל־שְׁאֵרִ֣ית יְהוּדָ֑ה אֲשֶׁר־\ **שָׁ֗בוּ** מִכָּל־הַגּוֹיִם֙
  kol-she'erith yehudah 'asher-**shavu** mikkol-haggoyim
  "whole\_remnant-of Judah that\_\ **they-returned**
     from-all\_the-nations"
  all the remnant of Judah who **had returned** from all the nations

Completed actions in present/future time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 28:15

  עַ֚ד אֲשֶׁ֣ר אִם־\ **עָשִׂ֔יתִי** אֵ֥ת אֲשֶׁר־דִּבַּ֖רְתִּי לָֽךְ
  'ad 'asher 'im-**'asithi** 'eth 'asher-dibbarti lakh
  until then when **I-have-done** [dir.obj] what\_I-have-spoken to-you.
  **I will do** all that I have promised to you.

Imaginary actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is an action described as a hypothetical situation.

.. csv-table:: Example: RUT 1:12

  כִּ֤י **אָמַ֙רְתִּי֙** יֶשׁ־לִ֣י תִקְוָ֔ה
  ki **'amartiy** yesh-li thiqwah
  if **I-said** there-is\_for-me hope
  "If **I said**, 'I hope I get a husband tonight,'"

.. csv-table:: Example: 1SA 14:30

  אַ֗ף כִּ֡י לוּא֩ אָכֹ֨ל **אָכַ֤ל** הַיּוֹם֙ הָעָ֔ם
  'af ki lu' 'akhol **'akhal** hayyom ha'am
  Oh if only eating **they-had-eaten** the-day the-people
  How much better if the people **had eaten** freely today

Stative actions (describing a state or condition)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This kind of action describes a state or a condition, usually with a
:ref:`verb-stative-or-non-action-verbs`
or a passive
:ref:`stem`.

.. csv-table:: Example: LAM 1:1

  אֵיכָ֣ה׀ **יָשְׁבָ֣ה** בָדָ֗ד הָעִיר֙
  'ekhah **yoshvah** vadad ha'ir
  How **it-sits** lonely the-city
  The city ... **is now sitting** all alone.

Performative actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is an action that is performed by speaking it.

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 23:11

  הַשָּׂדֶה֙ **נָתַ֣תִּי** לָ֔ךְ
  hassadeh **nathatti** lakh
  the-field **I-give** to-you
  **I give** you the field

Prophetic actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a very rare use of the perfect, occurring in prophetic
utterances.

.. csv-table:: Example: ISA 11:9

  כִּֽי־\ **מָלְאָ֣ה** הָאָ֗רֶץ דֵּעָה֙ אֶת־יְהוָ֔ה
  ki-\ **mol'ah** ha'arets de'ah 'eth-yehwah
  for\_\ **it-will-be-full** the-earth-of knowledge [dir.obj]\_Yahweh
  "for the earth **will be full** of knowledge of Yahweh"""

.. _verb_perfect-suffix-conjugation-copulative:

Suffix conjugation copulative
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This form adds the
:ref:`conjunction`
*waw* (וְ "and") to the normal Suffix Conjugation and can express any of
the above meanings. This form appears identical to the
:ref:`verb_sequential_perfect`.

.. csv-table:: Example: 1KI 12:32

  וְהֶעֱמִיד֙ בְּבֵ֣ית אֵ֔ל אֶת־כֹּהֲנֵ֥י
  **wehe'emid** beveth 'el 'eth-kohane
  **and-he-set-up** in-Bethel [dir.obj]\_priests
  **and he placed** priests in Bethel

.. csv-table:: Example: ISA 1:2

  בָּנִים֙ גִּדַּ֣לְתִּי וְרֹומַ֔מְתִּי
  banim giddalti **werowmamti**
  sons I-made-great **and-I-raised-up**
  I have nourished **and brought up** children
