Most relative clauses use relative particles rather than relative pronouns. The two relative pronouns are זֶה and זוּ, and these are usually in archaic poetry.


## Dependent clause

    * עַם־ז֣וּ גָּאָ֑לְתָּ 

    * people you have rescued 

* PSA 104:26

    * לִ֝וְיָתָ֗ן זֶֽה־יָצַ֥רְתָּ 

    * Leviathan, which you formed 

Sometimes the pronoun referring to the subject of the relative phrase is repeated

* ISA 25:9

    * הִנֵּ֨ה אֱלֹהֵ֥ינוּ זֶ֛ה קִוִּ֥ינוּ ל֖וֹ 

    * Look, this is our God; we have waited for him  (literally, Look this is our God whom we have waited for him)

* PSA 74:2

    * הַר־צִ֝יּ֗וֹן זֶ֤ה ׀ שָׁכַ֬נְתָּ בּֽוֹ 

    * Mount Zion, where you live (literally, Mount Zion, where you live on it)

## Independent clause

* JOB 19:19

    * וְזֶֽה־אָ֝הַ֗בְתִּי נֶהְפְּכוּ־בִֽי 

    * those whom I love have turned against me 

* JOB 15:17

    * וְזֶֽה־חָ֝זִ֗יתִי וַאֲסַפֵּֽרָה 

    * I will announce to you the things I have seen (Literally, That which I have seen I will announce to you)

* JDG 5:5

    * הָרִ֥ים נָזְל֖וּמִפְּנֵ֣י יְהוָ֑ה זֶ֣ה סִינַ֔י מִפְּנֵ֕י יְהוָ֖ה אֱלֹהֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל 

    * The mountains quaked before the face of Yahweh; even Mount Sinai quaked before the face of Yahweh, the God of Israel.(Literally, The mountains quaked before the face of Yahweh, the one of Sinai, before the face of Yahweh, the God of Israel)
