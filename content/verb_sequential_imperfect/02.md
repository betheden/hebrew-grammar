# verb_sequential_imperfect Article
The sequential imperfect form looks similar to a normal imperfect verb, but it is a completely separate verbal form and must be treated as such. **A sequential imperfect verb does not function like an imperfect verb.  Rather, it acts like an *perfect* verb, but with an added sense of progression.**  Thus, a sequential imperfect verb is connected to some earlier verb to form a sequence, either a sequence of time or a sequence of thought. The sequential imperfect form takes the same verbal endings as the imperfect form but includes a *specialized* form of the conjunction as a prefix.  In Hebrew narratives, a new sentence usually begins with a sequential imperfect verb.

 **There is a difference between the sequential imperfect form and a normal imperfect form with the conjunction.**  A normal imperfect form with the conjunction looks exactly like what one would expect: a normal conjunction (וְ) is added to the beginning of a normal imperfect form (יִקְטֹל) to make a single word (וְיִקְטֹל).  However, the sequential imperfect form looks significantly different (וַיִּקְטֹל).  In contrast to the normal imperfect with the conjunction, the sequential imperfect form usually contains (1) a vowel (usually pathach) under the conjunction instead of the shewa, and (2) a daghesh in the prefix consonant of the verbal form (see examples below).

> Hebrew verb כָּתַב: normal imperfect + conjunction = וְיִכְתֹּב; sequential imperfect = וַיִּכְתֹּב.
> 
> Hebrew verb פָּעַל: normal imperfect + conjunction = וְיִפְעַל; sequential imperfect = וַיִּפְעַל.
> 
> Hebrew verb קָרָא: normal imperfect + conjunction = וְיִקְרָא; sequential imperfect = וַיִּקְרָא.

In Hebrew narratives, the sequential imperfect verb serves an important function to control the flow of a story.  This is true of general narratives as well as specific narratives spoken by characters within the story of a text (see 2 Sam 12:4-5).  This function of controlling the flow of a narrative is clearly seen in Gen 5:6-8 (below).  **NOTE: The flow of a narrative does not always indicate a sequence of time, but can sometimes indicate a sequence of thought.**  Both of these are seen in the example below.

> [v.6] וַֽיְחִי־שֵׁ֕ת חָמֵ֥שׁ שָׁנִ֖ים וּמְאַ֣ת שָׁנָ֑ה וַיּ֖וֹלֶד אֶת־אֱנֽוֹשׁ׃
> 
> [v.7] וַֽיְחִי־שֵׁ֗ת אַֽחֲרֵי֙ הוֹלִיד֣וֹ אֶת־אֱנ֔וֹשׁ שֶׁ֣בַע שָׁנִ֔ים וּשְׁמֹנֶ֥ה מֵא֖וֹת שָׁנָ֑ה וַיּ֥וֹלֶד בָּנִ֖ים וּבָנֽוֹת׃
> 
> [v.8] וַיִּֽהְיוּ֙ כָּל־יְמֵי־שֵׁ֔ת שְׁתֵּ֤ים עֶשְׂרֵה֙ שָׁנָ֔ה וּתְשַׁ֥ע מֵא֖וֹת שָׁנָ֑ה וַיָּמֹֽת׃

> "***And Seth lived*** 105 years, ***and he fathered*** Enosh.  ***And Seth lived*** 807 years after he fathered Enosh, ***and he fathered*** sons and daughters. ***And*** all the days of Seth ***were*** 912 years, ***and he died***." [Gen 5:6-8]


The sequential imperfect form indicates any one of these kinds of verbal actions:

#### **1) Completed actions, or events in the past**
> Gen 3:2 –  וַתֹּ֥אמֶר הָֽאִשָּׁ֖ה אֶל־הַנָּחָ֑שׁ "***And the woman said*** to the serpent, ..."
> 
> Gen 5:29 –  וַיִּקְרָ֧א אֶת־שְׁמ֛וֹ נֹ֖חַ  "***And he called*** his name, 'Noah'..."


#### **2) A state of affairs (usually stative or passive)**
> Gen 2:1 – וַיְכֻלּ֛וּ הַשָּׁמַ֥יִם וְהָאָ֖רֶץ "***And*** the heavens and the earth ***were finished***..."
> 
> Gen 7:24 –  וַיִּגְבְּר֥וּ הַמַּ֖יִם עַל־הָאָ֑רֶץ  "***And the waters flooded*** the earth..." [Literally, 'the waters were strong over the earth']


#### **3) Actions that are paired together in a sentence (often with the verb היה)**
> Gen 19:14 – וַיֵּצֵ֨א ל֜וֹט וַיְדַבֵּ֣ר׀ אֶל־חֲתָנָ֣יו "***And Lot went out and spoke*** to his sons-in-law..."
> 
> Gen 20:3 – וַיַּשְׁכֵּ֨ם אַבְרָהָ֜ם בַּבֹּ֗קֶר וַֽיַּחֲבֹשׁ֙ אֶת־חֲמֹר֔וֹ   "***And Abraham rose early*** in the morning ***and saddled*** his donkey, ..."
> 
> Gen 21:22 –  וַֽיְהִי֙ בָּעֵ֣ת הַהִ֔וא וַיֹּ֣אמֶר אֲבִימֶ֗לֶךְ   "***And it happened*** at that time ***that Abimilech said***, ..."
