Stem Qal Passive
================

Summary
-------

The Qal Passive is a passive form of the Qal stem. It looks similar to
(and is sometimes identified as) the Pual or the Hophal stem.

Article
-------

The Qal Passive form is a
:ref:`stem`
formation in Biblical Hebrew that expresses simple action in passive
voice. There is some debate among scholars concerning all the
:ref:`verb`
that are parsed as Qal Passive, because they could also be identified as
either a
:ref:`stem_pual`
or a
:ref:`stem_hophal`.
This distinction is not important for meaning or translation.
