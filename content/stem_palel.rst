expresses the same range of meanings.

Article
-------

The Palel :ref:`stem<stem>` is a variation of the :ref:`Piel<stem_piel>`
and has potential to express the same range of verbal action. It is the
same stem formation as the
:ref:`Pilel<stem_pilel>`,
only with a variant vowel pattern. The Palel stem is formed from the Piel
stem by repeating the 3rd radical (with different vowels), thus making a
verb that appears to have 4 consonants. It is an extremely :ref:`rare stem formation<stem-uncommon>`
in Biblical Hebrew. Many of the occurrences of the Palel stem in
the Hebrew Bible are from the root verb שָׁאַן ("to ").
