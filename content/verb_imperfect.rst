Verb Imperfect
==============

Summary
-------

A verb with prefix conjugation is used generally to indicate an action
that is not complete, or an action that either occurs in the present or
will occur in the future. However, the prefix conjugation can also be
used to describe other kinds of actions.

Article
-------

In Biblical Hebrew the Prefix Conjugation is used generally to describe
actions that are not completed or actions that occur in the present or
future. However, the Prefix Conjugation is also used to describe several
other kinds of actions as determined by the context. These include
frequentive or durative actions, negative commands, indirect commands,
potential actions, and actions of greater or lesser desirability
(similar to
:ref:`verb_jussive`
and
:ref:`verb_cohortative`).

The normal Prefix Conjugation with the
:ref:`conjunction`
*waw* (וְ "and") as a prefix is different from the :ref:`verb_sequential_imperfect`,
which utilizes a specialized form of the conjunction and contains a
different meaning. Sometimes a
:ref:`verb`
with Prefix Conjugation occurs within a clause after another :ref:`verb-finite-verbs`
(as in Gen 49:27 below, supplying the linking verb *to be*). In these
cases, the context must determine whether the Prefix Conjugation verb is
complementing the main verb or whether it is communicating its own
verbal idea.
