# stem_palel Article

The Palel stem is a variation of the [Piel stem](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_piel/02.md) and has potential to express the same range of verbal action. It is the same stem formation as the [Pilel](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_pilel/02.md), only with an alternate vocalization. The Palel stem is formed from the Piel stem by repeating the 3rd radical (with alternate vowels), thus making a verb that appears to have 4 consonants.  It is an extremely rare verbal form in Biblical Hebrew. Many of the occurrences of the Palel stem in the Hebrew Bible are from the root verb שָׁאַן ("to "). It is recommended to *always* consult a dictionary or lexicon for the precise nuance of any verb in the Palel stem.
