# stem_palel Article

The Palel stem is a variation of the [Piel stem](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_piel/02.md) and has potential to express the same range of verbal action.  The Palel stem is formed from the Piel stem by dropping the 2nd radical and repeating the 3rd radical (with a vowel shift).  It is an extremely rare verbal form in Biblical Hebrew.  It is recommended to *always* consult a dictionary or lexicon for the precise nuance of any verb in the Palel stem.
