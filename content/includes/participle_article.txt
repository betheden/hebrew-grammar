In Biblical Hebrew, participles are :ref:`non-finite<verb-non-finite>` verbal forms that can change their form based on 
:ref:`stem formation<stem>` (like :ref:`verbs<verb>`) as well as person, gender, state, and :ref:`defniteness<definiteness>`
(like both :ref:`adjectives<adjective>` and :ref:`nouns<noun>`).
Participles are very flexible in their grammatical use and can function as a verbal complement, a 
:ref:`finite<verb-finite>` main verb, an :ref:`adjective<adjective>`, or a :ref:`noun<noun>`.  
In most cases, the context will clearly show how the participle is being used in the sentence. The meaning of a participle is 
usually clear, even in cases where its specific grammatical function cannot be determined precisely.
