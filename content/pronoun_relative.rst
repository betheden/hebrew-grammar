Summary

Relative pronouns are pronouns which function as a relative particle, that is, to introduce a phrase or clause that describes a noun.

Either term is correct.  In English, the relative pronouns include: “who", "what", “that", “which", "when", or "where".
In most cases, Biblical Hebrew simply uses either the :ref:`relative particle<particle_relative>` אֲשֶׁר or the prefix -שֶׁ to
introduce a relative clause.  However, in rare instances Biblical Hebrew uses certain other pronouns to serve this same function.

.. note:: In Biblical Hebrew, the terms "relative pronoun" and "relative particle" are two different names for the same thing.
