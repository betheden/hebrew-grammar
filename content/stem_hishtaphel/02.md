The histaphel (השתפל) stem is an very rare stem which remained in Hebrew from Proto-Semitic and is made up of the root letters combined with the causative morpheme ש and the infixed ת. The primary evidence for this is from Ugaritic. In the Bible this stem shows up almost exclusively in the common השתחוה, to worship, to prostrate oneself, which appears to be a hishtaphel from the root הוי.
