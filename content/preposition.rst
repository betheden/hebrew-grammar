Preposition
===========

Summary
-------

A preposition introduces a phrase that describes another word/concept within a sentence, usually a :ref:`noun<noun>` or a :ref:`verb<verb>`.
However, like :ref:`adverbs<adverb>` and :ref:`particles<particle>`, sometimes a prepositional phrase can describe the sentence as a whole.
In Biblical Hebrew, prepositions can also be used with an infinitive construct verb to show its relationship to the main verb of a sentence.

Biblical Hebrew has four main prepositions: the prefix בְּ (in, at, by);
the prefix לְ (to, for); the prefix כְּ (as, like); and the prefix מִ
(which is a shortened form of the independent preposition מִן, meaning
"from"). However, there is also a family of other prepositions in
Biblical Hebrew. It is common in Biblical Hebrew for prepositions to be
combined together or with a noun to form new words that have their own
range of meanings (similar to :ref:`compound conjunctions<conjunction-compound>`)
that may or may not overlap with the meaning of the individual component terms.

In Biblical Hebrew, prepositions also function to describe the relationship between a
:ref:`non-finite<verb-non-finite>` verbal complement (:ref:`infinitive construct<infinitive_construct>` verbs
and :ref:`active<participle_active>` or :ref:`passive<participle_passive>` participles) and the :ref:`finite<verb-finite>` 
main verb of a sentence. In some of these instances, the preposition introduces a dependent verbal phrase
and thus changes its typical meaning. These specialized uses of prepositions are listed in the article
on :ref:`infinitive construct<infinitive_construct>` verbs.

In Biblical Hebrew, there are 11 general categories of prepositions: spatial; temporal; locative; directional; instrumental;
causal; explantory; correlative (the primary use of כְּ); comparative (a common use of מִן);
indirect object (a common use of לְ); and direct object (a rare use of לְ).

.. note:: Of all the different kinds of words, prepositions are perhaps the
          most flexible in their meaning and are often translated in a variety of
          ways, or sometimes even left untranslated. For this reason, prepositions
          must always be translated with great sensitivity to the context of each
          use. A dictionary or lexicon will describe the various possible meanings
          of each preposition, but generally will not include a complete list of
          individual usages.
