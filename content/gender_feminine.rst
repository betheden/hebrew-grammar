Gender Feminine
===============

Summary
-------

In Biblical Hebrew, all
:ref:`noun`,
finite
:ref:`adjective`,
`pronouns <https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/pronoun/01.md>`__,
:ref:`suffix_pronominal`,
and some
`particles <https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/particle/01.md>`__
are grammatically marked for gender. This gender marking can be
:ref:`gender_feminine`,
:ref:`gender_common`,
or
:ref:`gender_both`.

Article
-------

In Biblical Hebrew, every
:ref:`noun`
is classified according to gender, either
:ref:`gender_masculine`
or feminine or
:ref:`gender_both`.
Adjectives and other descriptors change endings when they refer to a
noun. This is because
:ref:`adjective`
agree with the gender of the noun they refer to. The gender of a :ref:`verb-finite-verbs`
agrees with its subject. All references to female persons in Biblical
Hebrew are grammatically masculine. However, other entities apart from
people can also be classified as grammatically-masculine. For example,
the `propernames <https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/noun_proper_name/01.md>`__
of places are often feminine in Biblical Hebrew, as well as body parts
that exist as pairs (hand, foot, etc.).

Form
----

Feminine :ref:`number_singular` :ref:`noun`
and :ref:`adjective`
usually end in either ה or ת. Feminine
:ref:`number_dual`
nouns end in patach-yod-hireq-final mem, as in יָדַיִם (hands). Feminine
:ref:`number_plural`
nouns and adjectives usually end in וֹת, as in תּוֹרוֹת (laws).

.. note:: Some feminine nouns do NOT take feminine endings, even some common
          nouns such as אֵם (mother) and אֶרֶץ (earth). They appear to be
          masculine nouns, but they are actually feminine nouns. A dictionary or
          lexicon will indicate the proper gender for each word.

Paradigm
~~~~~~~~

Besides nouns, a feminine word can be recognized by a variety of changes
to the form. This paradigm shows a sample of the kinds of changes that
signal a feminine form.
