Person Third
============

Summary
-------

The third person form of a term refers to a person(s) or thing(s) other than the writer/reader or speaker/listener.

Article
-------

In English, the third person pronouns include: "he", "him", "his", "she", or "her", for singular; and "they", "them",
or "their," for plural.  In Biblical Hebrew, terms which are marked for third person can change form according to both gender
(:ref:`masculine<gender_masculine>` and :ref:`feminine<gender_feminine`>) and number (:ref:`number_singular` or
:ref:`number_plural`). In Biblical Hebrew, :ref:`verbs<verb>`, :ref:`pronouns<pronoun_personal>`,
and :ref:`pronominal suffixes<suffix_pronominal>` can all be marked for third person.


Form
----

In Biblical Hebrew, a term marked for third person can be recognized by a variety of
changes to the form. These changes differ greatly from each other, so it is difficult to sum them up 
in a simple, helpful way. The paradigm below shows a sample of the kinds of changes that signal a third person form.
