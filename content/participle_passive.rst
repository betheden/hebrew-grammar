Participle Passive
==================

Summary
-------

A passive participle is a non-finite verbal form with passive or reflexive voice that can function as a :ref:`verb<verb>`(or verbal complement), an adjective, or a noun.
In Biblical Hebrew, passive participles most often function as either an :ref:`attributive<adjective-attributive>` adjective or a :ref:`predicative<adjective-predicative>` adjective.

.. note:: Only the :ref:`Qal<stem_qal>` stem
          has a distinct passive form for the participle; in all other cases, the
          passive (or sometimes reflexive) meaning is determined by the :ref:`stem formation<stem>`
          and the specific verb.

Function
--------

A passive/reflexive participle is often used as an independent
grammatical entity, although it can introduce entire clauses similar to the :ref:`active<participle_active>` participle.
Passive participles are generally more limited in meaning than active participles. 
Passive participles are governed either by the main verb of a sentence or by the
context; thus, they can express action in past time, present time,
future time, or without any specified timeframe.

.. _participle_passive-adjectival:

Functions as an :ref:`adjective<adjective>`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the most common use of the passive participle in Biblical Hebrew.
An adjectival passive participle can function as either an :ref:`attributive<adjective-attributive>` adjective 
or a :ref:`predicative<adjective-predicative>` adjective.  The context must determine whether a passive participle
is functioning as a predicative adjective or as a main verb, because both appear the
same in many instances (compare EXO 5:16 and 1SA 19:11).

The following example shows a passive participle functioning as an attributive adjective.

.. csv-table:: Example: PSA 149:9

  לַעֲשׂ֤וֹת בָּהֶ֨ם׀ מִשְׁפָּ֬ט כָּת֗וּב
  la'asoth bahem mishpat **kathuv**
  to-do to-them judgment **written**
  They will execute the judgment **that is written**

The following example shows a passive participle functioning as a predicative adjective.

.. csv-table:: Example: EXO 5:16

  וְהִנֵּ֧ה עֲבָדֶ֛יךָ מֻכִּ֖ים
  wehinneh 'avadeykha **mukkim**
  and-behold your-servants **beaten**
  "We, your servants, are even **beaten** now"

The following example shows passive participles introducing an entire clause that functions as a predicative adjective.

.. csv-table:: Example: PSA 22:7

  "וְאָנֹכִ֣י תוֹלַ֣עַת וְלֹא־אִ֑ישׁ **חֶרְפַּ֥ת** אָ֝דָ֗ם **וּבְז֥וּי**
     עָֽם׃"
  we'anokhi thola'ath welo-'ish **herpath** 'adam **uvezuy** 'am
  "and-I worm and-not\_man **scorned-of** humanity **and-despised-of**
     people"
  "But I am a worm and not a man, a **disgrace** to humanity **and
     despised** by the people."

.. _participle_passive-verbal-MV:

Functions as a :ref:`finite<verb-finite>` main verb
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The context must determine whether a passive participle is functioning as a main verb or as a predicative adjective,
because both appear the same in many instances (compare 1SA 19:11 and EXO 5:16). In the following example, the participle
is in the first position, which is the normal :ref:`word order<word_order>` for finite verbs but not for participles.

.. csv-table:: Example: ISA 17:2

  עֲזֻב֖וֹת עָרֵ֣י עֲרֹעֵ֑ר
  **'azuvoth** 'are 'aro'er
  **being-forsaken** cities-of Aroer
  The cities of Aroer **will be abandoned**

.. csv-table:: Example: 1SA 19:11

  מָחָ֖ר אַתָּ֥ה מוּמָֽת
  mahar 'attah **mumath**
  tomorrow you **being-made-dead**
  tomorrow you **will be killed**

.. _participle_passive-verbal-VC:

Functions as a :ref:`non-finite<verb-non-finite>` verbal complement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note:: The subject of a verbal participle usually
          precedes the participle, in contrast to the normal conventions of Hebrew
          :ref:`word order<word_order>`.

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 38:25

  הִ֣וא **מוּצֵ֗את** וְהִ֨יא שָׁלְחָ֤ה אֶל־חָמִ֙יהָ֙ לֵאמֹ֔ר
  hiw **mutseth** wehi sholhah 'el-hamiha lemor
  she **being-brought-out** and-she sent to\_her-father-in-law saying
  "When she **was brought out**, she sent to her father-in-law a message"

.. _participle_passive-nominal:

Functions as a :ref:`noun<noun>`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. csv-table:: Example: JOS 8:34

  כְּכָל־\ **הַכָּת֖וּב** בְּסֵ֥פֶר הַתּוֹרָֽה׃
  kekhol-\ **hakkathuv** besefer hattowrah
  like-all\_\ **the-written** in-book-of the-law
  just as **had been written** in the book of the law
