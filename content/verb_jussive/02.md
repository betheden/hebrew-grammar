# verb_jussive Article
The jussive form looks very similar to an imperfect form but functions in the sentence more like an imperative.  Jussive verbs usually appear in 3rd person forms.  [Similarly, imperatives appear only in 2nd person forms, and cohortatives appear only in 1st person forms.]  A jussive verb does not carry the full force of a command (*"He must do this!"*), but it conveys a stronger meaning than a simple suggestion or statement of possibilty (*"He could do this."*).  The meaning is somewhere in the middle.  In English, a jussive is often translated with the helping verb "may" or "let," depending on the context (*"May he do this!"* or *"Let him do this!"*).  Thus, the jussive verb functions as an indirect command; the reader must examine the context to determine the strength of desirability being expressed in each specific instance.  In Biblical Hebrew, it is possible for the imperfect form to express a jussive meaning.

***[Editorial note: How are verbs being tagged where there is no distinct jussive form?  Are they being tagged as "jussive" or "imperfect"?  This makes a difference in how this article should be written.  I have written this as if they are tagged as "imperfect."  But if they are tagged as jussive, then this section should be slightly altered.  Examples in Psa 51:9 and Exo 34:9.]***

Biblical Hebrew does not use the imperative form to express negative commands.  Rather, negative commands are always expressed using either the imperfect form or the jussive form.  In cases where the jussive form is being used to express a negative command, the jussive will appear in a 2nd person form rather than a 3rd person form.  When used in this way, the jussive form takes the negation particle אַל and expresses a *temporary* prohibition.


The jussive form can indicate any of the following kinds of actions:

#### Indirect commands

* GEN 1:3
    *  יְהִ֣י א֑וֹר  
    *  [insert transliteration]
    *  let there be light
    *  "Let there be light"

#### Actions of greater or lesser desirability (requests, invitations, wishes, etc.)

* 2SA 19:38
    * וַיֹּ֣אמֶר הַמֶּ֗לֶךְ אִתִּי֙ יַעֲבֹ֣ר כִּמְהָ֔ם
    * [insert transliteration]
    * and he said the king 'with me he will pass over Chimham'
    * "The king answered, 'Kimham will go over with me'"

* GEN 33:14
    *  יַעֲבָר־נָ֥א אֲדֹנִ֖י לִפְנֵ֣י עַבְדּ֑וֹ  
    *  [insert transliteration]
    *  he should pass over please my lord before his servant
    *  "Please let my master go one ahead of his servant"

* 1SA 10:24
    *  וַיֹּאמְר֖וּ יְחִ֥י הַמֶּֽלֶךְ׃ 
    *  [insert transliteration]
    *  and they said 'let him live the king'
    *  "All the people shouted, 'Long live the king!'"


#### Temporary prohibitions (2nd person forms with negation particle אַל)

* GEN 37:22
    *  וְיָ֖ד אַל־תִּשְׁלְחוּ־ב֑וֹ  
    *  [insert transliteration]
    *  and hand not you must stretch out on him
    *  "...but lay no hand upon him..."
