==============

Summary
-------

The absolute state is the standard form of the noun. It can either
appear by itself, or at the end of a construct chain.

Form
----

A
:ref:`noun`
(or
:ref:`adjective`)
in the absolute state has the standard dictionary form in the
:ref:`number_singular`,
or the standard
:ref:`number_plural`
form. It can have a preposition, but it cannot have a :ref:`suffix_pronominal`.

  "Noun, feminine plural absolute",סוּסוֹת,susoth,mares

Function
--------

The absolute state is the normal form of the noun, or adjective, and it
will always be in the absolute state unless something in the context
forces it to become a :ref:`state_construct`.
The absolute state means that the word is independent and can stand on
its own, while a construct word cannot. See also: :ref:`infinitive_absolute`.

By itself
~~~~~~~~~

If a noun occurs "by itself" as the only word of a subject or object, it
is in the absolute state.

.. csv-table::

  בָּרָ֣א **אֱלֹהִ֑ים** אֵ֥ת **הַשָּׁמַ֖יִם** וְאֵ֥ת **הָאָֽרֶץ**\ ׃
  bara **'elohim** 'eth **hashamayim** we'eth **ha'arets**
  "he-created **God** [dir.obj] **the-heavens** and-[dir.obj]
     **the-earth**."
  **God** created **the heavens** and **the earth**.

   Both "God", the subject, and "the heavens" and "the earth", the two
   direct objects, are in the absolute state.

:ref:`noun_proper_name`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Names, or proper nouns, are always in the absolute state.

As part of a :ref:`state_construct` chain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a word in the absolute state is connected with a word in the
construct state, it forms a so-called construct chain, in which case the
word in the absolute state is always at the end of the chain.

Indefinite
^^^^^^^^^^

If all nouns form a construct chain and both are indefinite you can
sometimes translate with an indefinite article.

  וַעֲמָשָׂ֣א **בֶן**\ ־אִ֗ישׁ וּשְׁמֹו֙ יִתְרָ֣א
  wa'amasa **ven**-'ish ushemow yithra
  and-Amasa **son-of**\ \_man and-his-name Jether
  Amasa was **a son of** a man named Jether

-  EXO 15:3

.. csv-table::

  אִ֣ישׁ מִלְחָמָ֑ה
  'ish **milhamah**
  man-of **war**
  a **warr**\ ior

   In this example "a man of war" is an idiomatic expression, so the
   smooth translation reads "a warrior".

:ref:`state_determined`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the final, absolute, noun in a constuct chain is definite, the whole
chain is definite.

-  2SA 14:26

.. csv-table::

  בְּאֶ֥בֶן **הַמֶּֽלֶךְ**\ ׃
  be'even **hammelekh**
  in-weight-of **the-king**.
  by the weight of **the king**'s standard.

"weight" is in the construct state, and "the king" is both definite and
absolute. Because the absolute noun is definite, the construct noun is
also definite.
