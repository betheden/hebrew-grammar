# English Unlocked Hebrew Grammar

This is the repository for a reference grammar for biblical Hebrew based on the [morphology codes](http://openscriptures.github.io/morphhb/parsing/HebrewMorphologyCodes.html) that show up in the [Open Scriptures Hebrew Bible](https://github.com/openscriptures/morphhb).

## Roadmap

### First stage

Start fresh and provide descriptions of grammatical concepts that show up in [Open Scriptures Hebrew Bible](https://github.com/openscriptures/morphhb) morphological data

* 1-2 sentence that is pop-upable in the `01.md` files (Glossary entry)
* ~1 page entry that provides more information and 2-3 examples like teaching grammars in `02.md` files (Article entry)

### Second stage

* Tag the UHB with specific grammatical information (*interrogative* pronoun)

### Third stage

* Write syntax glossary and article entries
* Tag text with syntax information
