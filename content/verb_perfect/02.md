# verb_perfect Article
**Generally speaking, in Biblical Hebrew the perfect form is used to describe either actions that are completed or actions that occurred in the past from the perspective of the writer/speaker.**  (This is in opposition to the imperfect form, which is used to describe either actions that are not completed or actions that occur in the present/future from the perspective of the writer/speaker.)  However, the perfect form is also used to describe several other kinds of actions (see below), as determined by the context.  For this reason, **the reader must carefully examine the context of each instance of a perfect verb to ensure that the proper sense of the verb is understood as best as possible.**  This is especially true in Hebrew poetry.

**When the conjunction is added to the perfect form as a prefix, this can indicate either a normal perfect form (with the conjunction) or a sequenctial perfect form.**  The meaning of the verb is different in each case. See the article on Sequential Perfect verbs for more information regarding how to identify the sequential perfect form and how it differs in meaning from the normal perfect verb.

The perfect form can indicate any of the following kinds of actions:

#### 1) Simple past/completed actions (can be distant past, immediate past, etc.)

> Gen 1:5 –  וְלַחֹ֖שֶׁךְ קָ֣רָא לָ֑יְלָה  "...and to the darkness ***he called out***, 'Night'..."
> 
> Gen 4:10 -  וַיֹּ֖אמֶר מֶ֣ה עָשִׂ֑יתָ  "And he said, 'What ***have you done***?'..."
> 
> Gen 31:32 –  וְלֹֽא־יָדַ֣ע יַעֲקֹ֔ב כִּ֥י רָחֵ֖ל גְּנָבָֽתַם׃  "...but Jacob did not know that Rachel ***had stolen*** them."

#### 2) Completed actions that have not yet occurred from the perspective of the writer/speaker

> Gen 24:33 –  לֹ֣א אֹכַ֔ל עַ֥ד אִם־דִּבַּ֖רְתִּי דְּבָרָ֑י  "...I will not eat until ***I have spoken*** my message."

#### 3) Imaginary actions (hypothetical situations, or desires that cannot come true)

Num 14:2 –    

Judg 8:19 – 

#### 4) A state of affairs (usually either a stative or passive verb)
