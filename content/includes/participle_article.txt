In Biblical Hebrew, participles are 
:ref:`verb-non-finite`
verbal forms that can change their form based on 
:ref:`stem`
formation (like :ref:`verb`\s) as well as person, gender, state, and definiteness (like both 
:ref:`adjective`\s and :ref:`noun`\s).
Participles are very flexible in their grammatical use and can function
as a verbal complement, a 
:ref:`verb-finite`
verb, an :ref:`adjective`,
or a :ref:`noun`.  
In most cases, the context will clearly show how the 
participle is being used in the sentence. The meaning of a participle is 
usually clear, even in cases where its specific grammatical function cannot 
be determined precisely.
