# particle_affirmation Article
Biblical Hebrew contains three major particles that, used either individually or in combination, express an "affirmation of" or "addition to" some aspect of the text. These particles can have a scope as narrow as a single word or phrase, or as broad as an entire sentence or paragraph.  

## אַף
This word is flexible and can function as a particle, a [conjunction](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/conjunction/02.md), or an [adverb](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/adverb/02.md#-3). This word does not have a single translation value, but must be translated in accordance with its context.  In English, אַף is often translated with a family of different words, including "also", "indeed", "truly", and/or other terms that can convey the general concepts of affirmation or addition.

## גַּם
Like אַף, this word can function sometimes as a [conjunction](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/conjunction/02.md) and sometimes as an [adverb](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/adverb/02.md#-2). This word does not have a single translation value, but must be translated in accordance with its context.  In English, גַּם is often translated with a family of different words, including "also", "indeed", "even", and/or other terms that can convey the general concepts of affirmation or addition.

## כִּי

NOTE: כִּי is one of the most flexible words in Biblical Hebrew in terms of its meaning. It can function either as a conjunction or as a particle, with many different potential meanings. If in doubt, it is recommended to *always* consult a dictionary or lexicon to confirm how the word is being used in any specific instance.
