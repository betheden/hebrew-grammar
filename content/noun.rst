Noun

Summary
-------

A noun is a person, a thing, a place, or an idea.

Article
-------

Every noun also has a number, which can be
:ref:`number_plural`,
or
:ref:`number_dual`.
A noun also has a state, which can be
:ref:`state_construct`
or
:ref:`state_absolute`.
All nouns are either indefinite or definite (i.e. 
:ref:`state_determined`).
Nouns are listed in a dictionary by their singular absolute form. Nouns can also have a variety
of prefixes and
:ref:`suffix`es
that give extra information.

The form of the noun usually indicates its gender, which
can be
:ref:`gender_masculine`
or
:ref:`gender_feminine`.  
However, sometimes the gender of a noun does not match its form.

In Biblical Hebrew, nouns do not change their form based on the function (or
case) they have in a sentence (subject/nominative, direct
object/accusative, etc.). They only change if they are in :ref:`state_construct`.

Sometimes an adjective
:ref:`adjective-substantive`. Also, sometimes a 
:ref:`participle_active`, 
of a
:ref:`participle_passive`)
functions as a noun.
