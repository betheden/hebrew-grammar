# stem_piel Article

The Piel stem is a verbal [stem](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem/02.md) formation in Biblical Hebrew, usually indicated by a daghesh in the middle consonsant of the [verb](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/verb/02.md). The Piel stem is the most flexible in its use of all the stem formations in Biblical Hebrew, expressing various kinds of verbal action. These include simple action, intensive action, resultative action, causative action, or other kinds of action depending on the context and the specific verb.  Some verbs express simple action in the Piel stem; some verbs express intensive action in the Piel stem; for some verbs, the Piel stem might express either simple action or intensive action, depending on the context; and so on.

NOTE: It is recommended to *always* consult a dictionary or lexicon for the specific meaning of the Piel stem for any verb, because the Piel stem expresses different kinds of action for various verbs.

### Form

**[paradigm]**

### Function

The Piel stem can express any of the following kinds of verbal action:
 
#### Expresses simple action
In Biblical Hebrew, some verbs can express different meanings in different stem formations.  A good example is the Hebrew verb נָחַם.  In the Niphal stem, the verb נָחַם usually expresses either stative action (to be sorry) or passive action (to be comforted).  But in the Piel stem, the verb נָחַם expresses the simple action "to comfort".  A dictionary or lexicon will indicate the different meanings for these verbs in the various stem formations.

</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>for **you have comforted** me</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>...for **you have comforted** me,...</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

#### Expresses intensive action
Intensive action means that the verbal action is strengthened in some way. A good example is the Hebrew verb שָׁבַר.  In the Qal stem, the verb שָׁבַר means "to break". But in the Piel stem, the verb שָׁבַר means "to shatter" or "to break in pieces". A dictionary or lexicon will indicate an intensive nuance in comparison with the meaning of the verb in other stem formations.

</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>**Separate yourselves** from the midst of this congregation</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>**Separate yourselves** from among this community...</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

#### Expresses resultative action
Resultative action means that the primary focus of the verb is on the result of the verbal action.  A good example is the verb שָׁלַח.  In the Qal stem, the verb שָׁלַח means "to send" or "to stretch".  In the Piel stem, the verb שָׁלַח means "to send away".

</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>**and they will be opened** your eyes</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>your eyes **will be opened**</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

#### Expresses causative action
Causative action means that the subject of the verb is causing the object of the verb either to perform the verbal action (dynamic verbs) or to be in the state described by the verb (stative verbs).  The Piel stem often serves this causative function with stative verbs.  A good example in the verb מָלֵא.  In the Qal stem, the verb מָלֵא expresses the simple action of "to be full".  But in the Piel stem, the verb מָלֵא means "to fill" (meaning, *to cause something to be full*).

<tr class="row-odd"><td>**And he appeared** Yahweh to Abram</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Yahweh **appeared** to Abram,...</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

#### Expresses stative action

In Biblical Hebrew, some verbs express stative action in the *Niphal* stem rather than the *Qal* stem. This is a very rare use of the Niphal stem. Stative action is expressed most often using the Qal stem in Biblical Hebrew.

[Qal](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_qal/02.md) verbs that are intransitive may become transitive in Piel. 

* חלה means “to be sick” in Qal, but means “to make sick” in Piel. Deut 29:21. In Piel it requires an object.

* כתב means “to write” in Qal, but means “to be a scribe” in Piel. Jer 36:18 describes writing on one scroll, but Isa 10:1 describes scribes writing.



* כהן is a noun that means “priest,” but the verb in Exod 40:13 means “to serve as a priest.”
 
* בכר is a noun that means “firstborn,” but the verb in Ezek 47:12 means “to bear early fruit.”
 


* חלק  means “to apportion” in Qal. In Josh 14:5 the Israelites were in the process of apportioning the land. It means “to complete apportioning” in Piel. In Josh 19:51 the Israelites completed apportioning the land.


* אזרה means “scatter.” In Ezek 5:2 hair is scattered literally, but in Ezek 5:12 people are scattered to the winds.

### Piel can also invert the normal meaning of the [Qal](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_qal/02.md) verb.
* חטא means “to sin” in Qal. But in Num 19:19 the Piel describes a clean person “removing sin” from an unclean person.


Piel verbs have a doubled middle radical of the root, and it shows this with a dagesh in strong verbs. The dagesh is not there for weak or guttural middle radicals, nor when there is a shewa under it.

Piel [perfect](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/verb_perfect/02.md) verbs usually have hireq in the first syllable.
Piel [imperfect](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/verb_imperfect/02.md) vowels follow this pattern: shewa, pataq, sere
