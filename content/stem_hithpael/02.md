# stem_hithpael Article

The Hithpael stem is the reflexive form of the Piel [stem](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem/02.md) formation in Biblical Hebrew, usually indicated by a הִתְ prefix and a daghesh in the middle consonant of the [verb](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/verb/02.md). The Hithpael stem is quite flexible in its use in Biblical Hebrew.  Generally speaking, the Hithpael stem expresses the reflexive sense of the meaning of a verb in the Piel stem; but it can also express middle, reciprocal, or even simple action, depending on the context and the specific verb.

NOTE: It is recommended to *always* consult a dictionary or lexicon for the specific meaning of the Hithpael stem for any verb, because the Hithpael stem has potential to express many different kinds of action for various verbs.

## Form

***[insert paradigm]***

## Function

The Hithpael stem can express any of the following kinds of verbal action:

### Expresses the reflexive sense of the Piel stem
For most verbs that appear in both the Piel and Hithpael stems in Biblical Hebrew, the Hithpael stem expresses the same kind of action as the Piel stem (simple, intensive, resultative, causative, etc.) but in its reflexive sense.  A good example is the verb בָּקַע.  In the Qal stem, the verb בָּקַע means "to know" (simple action).  But in the Piel stem, the verb בָּקַע means "to make known" (causative action).  Thus, in the Hithpael stem, the verb בָּקַע means "to make oneself known" (reflexive causative action).

</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>**and he was buried** in the garden of his house</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>**and he was buried** in the garden of his own house</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Expresses simple action (often with a reflexive verb)
Some verbs use the Hithpael stem to express simple action of a verb that describes a reflexive action by its very nature.  TA good example is the verb יָלַד.  In the Qal stem, the verb יָלַד expresses the simple action "to give birth".  In the Piel stem, the verb יָלַד expresses the causative action "to cause to give birth" (meaning, *to serve as a midwife*).  But in the Pual stem, the verb יָלַד expresses the simple passive "to be born" (that is, the reflexive of the *Qal* stem rather the *Piel* stem).

<tr class="row-even"><td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Expresses middle action
Middle action means that the subject receives the action but also is (partially) involved in performing the action.  This kind of action stands somewhere between passive action and reflexive action.

<tr class="row-even"><td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Expresses reciprocal action
Reciprocal action means that multiple subjects are in view who are both performing the action for another and receiving the action from another.  In English, reciprocal action is expressed using the phrase "each other" as the object of the verb, "They tell each other."  In Biblical Hebrew, the reciprocal nature of the action is expressed by the Hithpael form of the verb itself without any additional words.  

Reciprocal action must be distinguished from reflexive action.  The phrase "They tell themselves" is reflexive: the subject "they" is a unified group and the action could be expressed reflexively for each individual as "he tells himself, and he tells himself, and she tells herself, etc."  The phrase "They tell each other" is reciprocal: each member of the group is telling something to another member of the group, and each member of the group is being told something by another member of the group.

<tr class="row-odd"><td>Why do you look at each other?</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Why do you look at one another?</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

### Expresses various other kinds of verbal action
Sometimes the Hithpael form functions in ways that do not follow the strictly the reflexive conventions of the Hithpael stem as listed above. Some verbs use the Hithpael stem to describe reciprocal action, middle action, passive action, and/or perhaps even stative or other kinds of verbal action. A dictionary or lexicon will indicate the correct meaning in these instances of the Hithpael stem. 

* DEU 1:37 –– the Hithpael form of the verb אָנַף ("to be angry") is always used in reference to Yahweh
<table border="1" class="docutils">

<tr class="row-even"><td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table> 

* NUM 19:19 –– the verb חָטָא means "to sin" in the Qal stem, but ִin the Piel stem it means "to purify"
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>וְחִטְּאוֹ֙ בַּיּ֣וֹם הַשְּׁבִיעִ֔י</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>wehitte'o bayyom hashevi'i</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>**and he purifies** him on the day the seventh</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>On the seventh day the unclean person **must purify** himself.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

* JOB 1:5 –– verbal action is the *opposite* of the normal meaning of the verb
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>אוּלַי֙ חָטְא֣וּ בָנַ֔י וּבֵרֲכ֥וּ אֱלֹהִ֖ים בִּלְבָבָ֑ם</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>'ulay hot'u vanay uverakhu 'elohim bilvavam</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>perhaps they have sinned my sons **and they have blessed** God in their hearts</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Perhaps my children have sinned **and cursed** God in their hearts.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Direct 

The subject does the action to itself; the subject is also the direct object of the verb.

* ISA 8:9
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>הִתְאַזְּרוּ</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>hith'azzeru</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>arm yourselves</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>arm yourselves</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Indirect 

The subject does the action to itself; the subject is also the indirect object of the verb.

* 1SA 18:4
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>וַיִּתְפַּשֵּׁט יְהוֹנָתָן אֶת־הַמְּעִיל</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>wayyithpashet yehonathan 'eth-hamme'il</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>And he took off Jonathan the robe</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Jonathan took off the robe</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

This means he took off the robe from himself

### Benefactive  

The subject does an action on its own behalf.

* 1KI 8:33
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>וְהִתְפַּלְלוּ וְהִתְחַנְּנוּ אֵלֶ֫יךָ</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>wehithpallu wehithhannenu 'eleykha</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>and they pray and seek favor to you</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>they pray, and request forgiveness from you</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Reciprocal

Two or more subjects act toward each other. This is rare. 



### Estimative

The subject presents itself in a certain way that may not be true.

* 2SA 13:5
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>שְׁכַב עַל־מִשְׁכָּבְךָ וְהִתְחָ֑ל</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>shekhav 'al-mishkavkha wehithhal</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>Lie down on your bed and pretend to be sick</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Lie down on your bed and pretend to be sick</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Passive 

Passive can mean either that something changes the subject into a new state or that the subject changes itself into a new state. 

Passive is usually found in later biblical literature.

* PRO 31:30
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>הִיא הִתְהַלָּל׃</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>hi hithhallal</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>she will be praised.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>she will be praised.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
This could be translated ‘she is made/caused to be praised’ or ‘she makes herself such as to be praised.’
