Person Second
=============

Summary
-------

The second person form of a term refers to the person(s) being addressed by a writer or speaker.

Article
-------

In English, the second person pronouns are "you" and "your," used for both singular and plural. In Biblical Hebrew, terms which
are marked for second personal can change form according to both gender (:ref:`masculine<gender_masculine>` and
:ref:`feminine<gender_feminine`>) and number (:ref:`number_singular` or :ref:`number_plural`).  In Biblical Hebrew, 
:ref:`verbs<verb>`, :ref:`pronouns<pronoun_personal>`, and :ref:`pronominal suffixes<suffix_pronominal>` can all be marked
for third person.

Neither English nor Hebrew have a formal second person address. In many languages (including German, Spanish, and French),
a speaker addresses God using an informal address. In some other languages, such as Dutch, a speaker addresses God using a
formal address. For more information, see `translationAcademy <http://ufw.io/academy/>`_ and

Form
----

In Biblical Hebrew, a term marked for second person can be recognized by a variety of
changes to the form. These changes differ greatly from each other, so it is difficult to sum them up 
in a simple, helpful way. The paradigm below shows a sample of the kinds of changes that signal a second person form.
