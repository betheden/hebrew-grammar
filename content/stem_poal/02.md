# stem_poal Article
The Poal stem is a variation of the [Pual stem](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_pual/02.md) and expresses the passive voice of the verbal action of the [Poel stem](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_poel/02.md). The Poal stem is formed from the Pual by a vowel change. It is an extremely rare verbal form in Biblical Hebrew.  It is recommended to *always* consult a dictionary or lexicon for the precise nuance of any verb in the Poal stem.
