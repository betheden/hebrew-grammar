Pronoun Relative
================

Summary
-------

Relative pronouns refer to or introduce nouns or phrases in relative
clauses. They can be translated as “who,” “that,” “which,” "when," or
"where."

Article

Most relative clauses use :ref:`particle_relative`
rather than relative pronouns. The main relative pronoun is זוּ, and it
is most commonly used in poetry.
