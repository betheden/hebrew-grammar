# verb_sequential_perfect Article
The sequential perfect form looks very similar to the normal perfect form, but it is a completely separate verbal form and must be treated as such. The sequential perfect form takes the same verbal endings as the perfect form but includes the conjunction *waw* as a prefix. A sequential perfect verb looks like a perfect verb with the conjunction, but it does not function that way. Rather, it acts more like an *imperfect* verb connected to the clause before it to form a sequence. Sequential perfect verbs often appear in a chain following a clause with an imperfect verb.

**NOTE: There is a difference between (1) the sequential perfect form, (2) a normal perfect form with the conjunction, and (3) a normal imperfect form with a conjunction.** (1) and (2) look identical, so the reader must determine which one is being used in the text by examining the accent pattern, the context, or both.  The sequential perfect form (#1 above) is usually accented on the final syllable, but the perfect form with the conjunction (#2 above) has the accent moved forward within the word (usually to the next-to-last syllable). (1) is also different than (3), although they can have similar meanings.  The sequential perfect verb (#1 above) forms a sequence with the verb in the clause before it, but the normal imperfect form (#3 above) with the conjunction does not. In Biblical Hebrew, (1) is used much more frequently than either (2) or (3).

The sequential perfect form can indicate any one of many different kinds of actions:

**1) Future actions;**
