# verb Article
A verb is a word in a sentence that describes either an action by the subject of a sentence, or the subject itself. The verb is therefore often the most important word in understanding a sentence or a clause.

## Form
In Hebrew, the root of a verb consists of three consonants, this is sometimes called the "Triliteral Root". In "strong" verbs, those three root consonants always stay the same and are easy to recognize, but "weak" verbs have one or more consonants that, in some forms, disappear.

Verbs in Biblical Hebrew change form according to both conjugation (prefix conjugation, suffix conjugation, etc.) and stem formation (Qal, Niphal, Piel, etc.).  Generally speaking, changes in verb forms happen by adding prefixes/suffixes, by changing the vowels, or both. These changes in form show the [stem](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem/02.md) formation of a verb ([Qal](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_qal/02.md), [Niphal](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_niphal/02.md), [Hiphil](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_hiphil/02.md), etc.), the conjugation of a verb ([Suffix Conjugation](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/verb_perfect/02.md), [Prefix Conjugation](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/verb_imperfect/02.md), [Infinitive Absolute](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/infinitive_absolute/02.md), etc.), the person ([First](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/person_fist/02.md), [Second](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/person_second/02.md), or [Third](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/person_third/02.md)), the gender ([Masculine](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/gender_masculine/02.md) or [Feminine](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/gender_feminine/02.md)), the number ([Singular](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/number_singular/02.md) or [Plural](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/number_plural/02.md)), and sometimes the state ([Absolute](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/state_absolute/02.md) or [Construct](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/state_construct/02.md)). The person, gender, and number of a verb always agree with the subject.

Unlike English, but similar to other languages like Spanish, it is not necessary to have a separate [personal pronoun](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/pronoun_personal/02.md) if the subject is not identified since the form of the verb includes the subject. A [pronominal suffix](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/suffix_pronominal/02.md) attached to a verb can function as its object.

## Types of verbs I
Grammarians often distinguish between different types of verbs. It is helpful to understand what kind of verb you are dealing with when looking for the best way to translate a sentence.

### Dynamic (or Action) verbs
Action verbs are used to describe a subject doing something.

* 2KI 1:5
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>וַיָּשׁ֥וּבוּ הַמַּלְאָכִ֖ים אֵלָ֑יו</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>wayyashuvu hammal'akhim 'elayw</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>And they returned, the messangers, to him</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>When the messengers returned to him</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

* JON 1:4
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>וַֽיהוָ֗ה הֵטִ֤יל רֽוּחַ־גְּדֹולָה֙ אֶל־הַיָּ֔ם</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>wayhwah hetil ruah-gedowlah 'el-hayyam</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>And Yahweh cast a great wind on the sea</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>But Yahweh sent out a great wind on the sea</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

#### Transitive verbs
A transitive verb is an action verb which requires an object that receives the verbal action. A sentence with a transitive verb would not be complete without the object.

* RUT 1:14
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>וַתִּשֶּׂ֣נָה קֹולָ֔ן</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>wattissenah qowlan</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>And they lifted up their voice</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Then they lifted up their voices</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
(Without object: "And they lifted up", they lifted up what?)

* PRO 7:1
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>שְׁמֹ֣ר אֲמָרָ֑י</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>shemor 'amaray</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>keep my words</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>keep my words</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

(Without object: "[you must] keep", you must keep what?)

#### Intransitive verbs
An intransitive verb is a verb that does NOT require an object to receive the verbal action.  A sentence with an intransitive verb is complete without an object.

* EXO 11:1
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>וַיֹּ֨אמֶר יְהוָ֜ה אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֗ה</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>wayyomer yehwah 'el-mosheh</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>And Yahweh *said* to Moses</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Then Yahweh *said* to Moses</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

* DAN 9:4
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>וָֽאֶתְפַּֽלְלָ֛ה לַיהוָ֥ה אֱלֹהַ֖י</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>wa'ethpalelah layhwah 'elohay</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>And I *prayed* to Yahweh my God</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>I *prayed* to Yahweh my God</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Stative (or Non-action) verbs
Unlike action verbs, stative verbs describe the way a subject is.

* GEN 48:10 (verb: "to be heavy")
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>וְעֵינֵ֤י יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ כָּבְד֣וּ מִזֹּ֔קֶן</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>we'ene yisra'el kovdu mizzoqen</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>And the eyes of Israel *were heavy* from age</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Now Israel's eyes *were failing* because of his age</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

* NUM 13:33
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>וַנְּהִ֤י בְעֵינֵ֨ינוּ֙ כַּֽחֲגָבִ֔ים</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>wannehi ve'enenu kahagavim</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>*And we were*, in our eyes, like grashoppers</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>In our own sight *we were* like grasshoppers</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
	
### Linking verbs
Linking verbs are verbs that link two [nouns](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/noun/02.md), or a noun and an [adjective](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/adjective/02.md). Hebrew has few linking verbs, so often a linking verb has to be supplied in English.

* RUT 2:6 –– sentence with linking verb "is", not present in the Hebrew)
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>נַעֲרָ֤ה מֹֽואֲבִיָּה֙ הִ֔יא</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>na'arah mow'aviyyah hi</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>Young woman Moabite she</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>She *is* the young Moabite woman</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


* 1SA 11:10 –– with linking verb "seems", not present in the Hebrew
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>כְּכָל־הַטֹּ֖וב בְּעֵינֵיכֶֽם׃</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>kekhol-hattowv be'enekhem</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>like all the good in your eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>whatever *seems* good to you.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Auxiliary and Modal verbs
Hebrew does not have auxiliary and modal verbs, but English does. It is often necessary to supply an auxiliary or modal verb in English to express what the Hebrew says.

#### Auxiliary verbs in translation
English uses auxiliary verbs in questions and negations, even if the Hebrew does not.

* 1SA 13:11
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>מֶ֣ה עָשִׂ֑יתָ</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>meh 'asitha</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>What you did?</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>What have you done?</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
(verb: "done", auxiliary verb in English: "have")

* EZR 5:5
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>וְלָא־בַטִּ֣לוּ הִמֹּ֔ו</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>wela-vattilu himmow</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>and not they stopped them</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>and they did not stop them</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
(verb: "stop", auxiliary verb in English: "did")

#### Modal verbs in translation
English uses modal verbs to express modality. In Hebrew this modality is already present in the form of the verb or implied by the context.

* LEV 14:22
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>אֲשֶׁ֥ר תַּשִּׂ֖יג יָדֹ֑ו</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>'asher tassig yadow</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>which he can reach</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>such as he is able to get</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
(verb: "reach/get", modal verb: "can/is able to")

* JOB 38:34
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>וְֽשִׁפְעַת־מַ֥יִם תְּכַסֶּֽךָּ׃</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>weshif'ath-mayim tekhassekka</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>and a large amount of water may cover you</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>so that an abundance of rainwater may cover you</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
(verb: "cover", modal verb: "may")

## Types of verbs II
Another way of distinguishing between different types of verbs is to separate finite verbs from non-finite verbs.

### Finite verbs
Finite verbs are verbs that have a subject and do not require any verbal complement to form a complete sentence. Their form shows tense ([perfect](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/verb_perfect/02.md), [imperfect](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/verb_imperfect/02.md), [imperative](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/verb_imperative/02.md), etc.), as well as person and number.

### Non-finite verbs
Properly speaking, non-finite verbs are verbal complements that require a finite verb to form a complete sentence.  Biblical Hebrew has three non-finite verb forms, namely the [infinitive absolute](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/infinitive_absolute/02.md), [infinitive contruct](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/infinitive_construct/02.md), and participles (both [active](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/participle_active/02.md) and [passive](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/participle_passive/02.md)).

NOTE: In Biblical Hebrew, the non-finite verb forms are sometimes used as finite verbs.

#### Verbal nouns
Non-finite verbs can sometimes describe an action or an event in such a way that the word functions like a [noun](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/noun/02.md).
