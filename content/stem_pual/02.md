# stem_pual Article
The Pual [stem](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem/02.md) is the passive form of the Piel stem formation in Biblical Hebrew.  The Pual stem is usually indicated by a daghesh in the middle consonsant of the [verb](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/verb/02.md) and a qibbuts vowel under the initial consanant. Generally speaking, the Pual stem expresses the passive sense of the meaning of a verb in the Piel stem.  Scholars sometimes disagree whether certain verb forms should be classified as belonging to the Pual stem or the Qal Passive stem.  In English, passive action is expressed using the helping verb "to be." In Biblical Hebrew, the passive nature of the verbal action is expressed by the Pual form of the verb itself without any helping verbs.

NOTE: It is recommended to *always* consult a dictionary or lexicon for the specific meaning of the Pual stem for any verb. This is because the Pual usually expresses the passive sense of the Piel stem, and the Piel stem has potential to express many different kinds of action for various verbs.

### Form

**[paradigm]**

### Function

The Pual stem can express any of the following kinds of verbal action:
 
#### Expresses the passive sense of the Piel stem
For most verbs that appear in both the Piel and Pual stems in Biblical Hebrew, the Pual stem will express the same kind of action as the Piel stem (simple, intensive, resultative, causative, etc.) but in its passive sense.  A good example is the verb בָּקַע.  In the Qal stem, the verb בָּקַע means "to cut open" or "to break open".  But in the Piel stem, the verb בָּקַע means "to rip open" (intensive action).  Thus, in the Pual stem, the verb בָּקַע means "to be ripped open" (passive intensive action).

#### Expresses simple passive action
Intensive action means that the verbal action is strengthened in some way. A good example is the Hebrew verb שָׁבַר.  In the Qal stem, the verb שָׁבַר means "to break". But in the Piel stem, the verb שָׁבַר means "to shatter" or "to break in pieces". A dictionary or lexicon will indicate an intensive nuance in comparison with the meaning of the verb in other stem formations.
