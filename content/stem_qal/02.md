# stem_qal Article
The Qal stem is a Hebrew verb stem. It is by far the most common stem and is the standard or simple, active form of the verb.
When a student first learns the different tenses (perfect, imperfect, participle, etc.), they are taught in the Qal, and all other verb stems (Niphal, Piel, Hiphil, etc.) are explained in how they are different, both in morphology and semantic value, from the standard Qal stem.
