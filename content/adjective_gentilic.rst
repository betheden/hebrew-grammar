==================

Summary

A gentilic adjective is another name for a gentilic noun that functions
like an attributive adjective.

In Biblical Hebrew, some :ref:`gentilic nouns<noun_gentilic>` that follow nouns in the
absolute state function like :ref:`attributive adjectives<adjective-attributive>`.
Some scholars call these "gentilic adjectives" instead of gentilic
nouns, and either term is grammatically correct.
