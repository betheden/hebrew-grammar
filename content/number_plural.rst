Function

Noun
~~~~

More than one
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the normal kind of plural, meaning more than one of a thing.

.. csv-table:: Example: ECC 10:7

  רָאִ֥יתִי **עֲבָדִ֖ים** עַל־סוּסִ֑ים
  ra'ithi **'avadim** 'al-**susim**
  I-have-seen **servants** on\_\ **horses**.

Plural of extension
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some nouns can be singular or plural even though they look plural.
Heaven/heavens and water/waters are common examples.

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 1:1

  בְּרֵאשִׁ֖ית בָּרָ֣א אֱלֹהִ֑ים אֵ֥ת הַשָּׁמַ֖יִם
  bereshith bara 'elohim 'eth **hashamayim**

  and-the-Spirit-of God was-moving on\_the-face-of **the-waters**.
  The Spirit of God was moving on the surface of the **waters**.

Abstract plurals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some plural words in Hebrew are translated as singular in other
languages. In English, abstract plurals are often singular and have
endings like -ness, -hood, and -ship.

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 19:11

  הִכּוּ֙ בַּסַּנְוֵרִ֔ים
  hikku **bassanwerim**
  they-hit **with-the-blindnesses**
  they struck them **with blindness**

  כִּֽי־יָלַ֥דְתִּי בֵ֖ן **לִזְקֻנָֽיו**\ ׃
  ki-yaladti ven **lizqunayw**
  for\_I-bore son **to-his-old-ages**
  yet I have borne him a son **in his old age**!

Summing up different parts of an action.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hebrew uses plurals for actions that have multiple parts, such as
embalming or committing adultery.

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 50:3

  כִּ֛י כֵּ֥ן יִמְלְא֖וּ יְמֵ֣י הַחֲנֻטִ֑ים
  ki ken yimle'u yeme **hahanutim**
  for so are-filled days-of **the-embalmings**.
  for that was the full time for **embalming**.

.. csv-table:: Example: JER 13:27

  נִֽאֻפַ֤יִךְ וּמִצְהֲלוֹתַ֙יִךְ֙ ... רָאִ֖יתִי
  **ni'ufayikh umitshalothayikh** ... ra'ithi
  **Your-adulteries and-your-neighings** ... I-have-seen
  I have seen **your adultery and neighing**

Adjectives
~~~~~~~~~~

If the noun or person to which the adjective relates is plural, the
adjective is also plural.

.. csv-table:: Example: DEU 8:12

  וּבָתִּ֥ים **טֹובִ֛ים** תִּבְנֶ֖ה וְיָשָֽׁבְתָּ׃
  uvottim **towvim** tivneh weyashavetta
  and-houses **good** you-will-built and-you-will-live
  and when you build **good** houses and live in them

Verbs
~~~~~

If the noun or person to which the verb relates is plural, the verb is
also plural.

.. csv-table:: Example: JER 43:7

  כִּ֛י לֹ֥א **שָׁמְע֖וּ** בְּק֣וֹל יְהוָ֑ה
  ki lo **shom'u** beqol yehwah
  for not **they-listened** to-voice-of Yahweh.
