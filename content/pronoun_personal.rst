Pronoun Personal
================

Summary
-------

In Biblical Hebrew, a personal pronoun is a word that indirectly refers to a particular person(s) or thing(s).  In English, the
following words are personal pronouns: "I", "we", "you", "he", "she", "they", "them".  

Article
-------

In Biblical Hebrew, personal pronouns change form according to gender (:ref:`masculine<gender_masculine>`, number
(:ref:`feminine<gender_feminine>`, and person (:ref:`first<person_first>`, :ref:`second<person_second>`, or
:ref:`third<person_third>`.  Grammatically they are very similar to :ref:`pronominal suffixes<suffix_pronominal>`, but they
stand alone rather than attaching to other kinds of words; also, they are more limited in their function.

As subject of a finite verb
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes an independent personal pronoun appears as the subject of a finite verb even though the pronominal subject is
already indicated by the verb form iteself.  In these cases, the personal pronoun functions to emphasize the personal role of
the subject in performing the verbal action.  When used in this way, the personal pronoun is often translated reflexively in
English: "myself", "yourself", etc.

.. csv-table:: Example: 1KI 18:22

  אֲנִ֞י נֹותַ֧רְתִּי נָבִ֛יא לַיהוָ֖ה
  **'ani** nowtharti navi layhwah
  **I** I-am-left prophet for-Yahweh
  "I, **I alone**, am left as a prophet of Yahweh"



As subject of a :ref:`verbal participle<participle_active>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. csv-table:: Example: DEU 8:1

  אָנֹכִ֧י מְצַוְּךָ֛
  **'anokhi** metsawwekha
  **I** am-commanding-you
  **I** am giving you

In apposition with a :ref:`noun<noun>` or :ref:`pronominal suffix<suffix_pronominal>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes a personal pronoun simply repeats a noun or pronominal suffix that has appeared earlier in the sentence. The specific
function of the repeated pronoun must be discerned from the context in these cases, but often the repetition expresses some
kind of emphasis on the identified person(s) or thing(s) within the sentence.

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 27:34

  בָּרֲכֵ֥נִי גַם־\ **אָ֖נִי** אָבִֽי
  barakheni gam-\ **'ani** 'avi
  Bless-me also\_\ **me** my-father
  "Bless me, **me** also, my father"
