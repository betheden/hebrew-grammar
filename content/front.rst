unfoldingWord® Hebrew Grammar
=============================

Introduction
------------

The unfoldingWord® Hebrew Grammar (UHG) is a Biblical Hebrew reference grammar
based on the `morphology codes <http://openscriptures.github.io/morphhb/parsing/HebrewMorphologyCodes.html>`__
that appear in the `Open Scriptures Hebrew Bible (OSHB) <https://github.com/openscriptures/morphhb>`__. It enables the
global Church to gain the best possible understanding of the Hebrew
grammar of the Old Testament.

Rationale
---------

The rationale behind creating the first version of the UHG was to
provide an openly licensed and up to date reference grammar for direct
use with the OSHB. Such a grammar may be used in
software to provide students and translators of Scripture with up to
date and accurate descriptions of Hebrew grammar on an as needed basis.
Because the articles are directly patterned after the morphological
categories of the OSHB, it is easy for software to link directly to
them.

Methodology
-----------

A team of scholars and technicians worked together to create and revise
each of the articles in the UHG over the course of a year and a half.
The creation process included individuals drafting glossary and article
entries for each grammatical topic and then a series of peer reviews of
each. Several meetings were held to help standardize the format of the
articles and to discuss difficult issues as they arose.

The differentiation between the glossary entries and the articles is
similar to the approach of many Wikipedia articles. The glossary entry
is a one or two sentence summary of the grammatical topic, while the
article goes into much more detail and includes several examples. This
has the effect of being useful in a pop up or tooltip in software
applications, which may provide immediate access to the glossary in the
pop up and then link to the full article.

A unique design goal was to make the language of the grammar as simple
as possible so that the resource can more easily be translated into the
`Gateway Languages <https://unfoldingword.org/gateway/>`__ of the world.
This should also have the effect of rendering the grammar accessible to
people of varied educational backgrounds and varied proficiency in the
English language.

The work was completed using an online content creation and translation
platform, the `Door43 Content Service <https://git.door43.org>`__.
Because of this, all the work is under revision control, you can go back
and see the `commit history <https://git.door43.org/unfoldingWord/en_uhg/commits/branch/master>`__
if you'd like (it totals over 2700 commits at the time of writing).

Future
------

We plan to extend the UHG, in conjunction with the unfoldingWord® Hebrew
Bible, to cover higher level syntactic and semantic information. Rather
than replacing the existing form-centric morphology of the OSHB, we
would add another parsing layer on top of it that focuses on the
function of the words and phrases. This will generate a new list of
categories that will need explanations in the UHG. Some examples of new
categories are discourse markers, specific uses of imperfect forms,
context sensitive gender identification and the like.

A further extension may be to take the raw material from this work and
augment and format it to be useful as a teaching grammar. Again, the
idea here would be to provide a resource that could easily be translated
and adapted into other Gateway Languages.

If either of these ideas intrigue you, let us know at
