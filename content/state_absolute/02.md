## Form
A [noun](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/noun/02.md) (or [adjective](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/adjective/02.md)) in the absolute state has the standard dictionary form in the [singular](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/number_singular/02.md), or the standard [plural](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/number_plural/02.md) form.
It can have a preposition, but it cannot have a [pronominal suffix](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/suffix_pronominal/02.md).

## Function
The absolute state is the normal form of the noun, or adjective, and it will always be in the absolute state unless something in the context forces it to become a [construct state](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/state_construct/02.md).
The absolute state means that the word is independent and can stand on its own, while a construct word cannot.

### By itself
If a noun occurs "by itself" as the only word of a subject or object, it is in the absolute state.

</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd" align="right"><td>בָּרָ֣א **אֱלֹהִ֑ים** אֵ֥ת **הַשָּׁמַ֖יִם** וְאֵ֥ת **הָאָֽרֶץ**׃</td>

</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>**God** created **the heavens** and **the earth**.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
Both "God", the subject, and "the heavens" and "the earth", the two direct objects, are in the absolute state.

### With a word in the [construct state](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/state_construct/02.md).
If connected with a word in the construct state, the absolute state is always at the end of the chain.

#### Indefinite

<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>

</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd" align="right"><td>אִ֣ישׁ <b>מִלְחָמָ֑ה</b></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>'ish **milhamah**</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>man-of **war**</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>a **warr**ior</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
"man" is in the construct state, and "war" is in the absolute state.

### [Definite](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/state_determined/02.md)

* 2SA 14:26
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd" align="right"><td>בְּאֶ֥בֶן **הַמֶּֽלֶךְ**׃</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>be'even **hammelekh**</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>in-weight-of **the-king**.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>by the weight of **the king**'s standard.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
"weight" is in the construct state, and "the king" is both definite and absolute. Because the absolute noun is definite, the construct noun is also definite.
