Summary
-------

Demonstrative particles are used to direct the attention of the reader or the listener.

Article

Biblical Hebrew has only a few demonstrative particles, with the two most common ones
being הִנֵּה and הֵ֣ן. The specific function of a demonstrative particle is to draw attention to what comes immediately
after it. Similar to the :ref:`exhortation particle<particle_exhortation>`, the demonstrative particle is often left untranslated.
