Suffix Directional He
=====================

Summary
-------

The directional (he) suffix at the end of a term expresses the concept of movement (either in space or in time) toward the word
(usually a person or thing) that takes the suffix.

Article
-------

This suffix should not be confused with the third person feminine singular :ref:`pronominal suffix<suffix_pronominal>`,
although it looks very similar. The directional ה (he) suffix is never accented, nor does it affect the vowel pattern of a word
in any way.  This is in contrast to the third person feminine singular pronominal suffix, which can take the accent and affects
the vocalization of the word to which it is attached.

Form
----

This suffix consists of a ה (he) consonant preceded by a qamets vowel.
