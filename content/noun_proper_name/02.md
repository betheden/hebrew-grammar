Proper nouns are always in the [absolute state](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/state_absolute/02.md). 

Hebrew does not use capital letters to signify proper names. Also, nouns do not change their form based on the function (or case) they have in a sentence (subject/nominative, direct object/accusative, etc.).
