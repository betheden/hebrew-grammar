In the example below, מֹשֶׁ֗ה "Moses" is a proper noun (because it is a name), but אִ֖ישׁ "man" is a [common noun](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/noun_common/02.md). Biblical Hebrew does not have capital letters to signify proper names. Proper nouns always appear in the [absolute state](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/state_absolute/02.md) and are considered [third person](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/person_third/02.md) [singular](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/number_singular/02.md) when used as subjects of verbs, direct objects, or referred to by personal pronouns or pronominal suffixes. They can be either [masculine](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/gender_masculine/02.md) or [feminine](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/gender_feminine/02.md).
