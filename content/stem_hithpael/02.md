# stem_hithpael Article

The Hithpael stem is the reflexive form of the Piel [stem](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem/02.md) formation in Biblical Hebrew, usually indicated by a הִתְ prefix and a daghesh in the middle consonant of the [verb](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/verb/02.md). Generally speaking, the Hithpael stem expresses the reflexive sense of the meaning of a verb in the Piel stem. However, the Hithpael stem is quite flexible in its use and can express other kinds of verbal action, depending on the context and the specific verb.

NOTE: It is recommended to *always* consult a dictionary or lexicon for the specific meaning of the Hithpael stem for any verb, because the Hithpael stem has potential to express many different kinds of action for various verbs.

## Form

***[insert paradigm]***

## Function

The Hithpael stem can express any of the following kinds of verbal action:

### Expresses the reflexive sense of the Piel stem
For most verbs that appear in both the Piel and Hithpael stems in Biblical Hebrew, the Hithpael stem expresses the same kind of action as the Piel stem (simple, intensive, resultative, causative, etc.) but in its reflexive sense.  A good example is the verb יָדַע.  In the Qal stem, the verb יָדַע means "to know" (simple action).  But in the Piel stem, the verb יָדַע means "to make known" (causative action).  Thus, in the Hithpael stem, the verb יָדַע means "to make oneself known" (reflexive causative action).

### Expresses simple reflexive action
The Hithpael stem can be used to express simple reflexive action in two ways. First, the Hithpael stem can express a reflexive nuance for a simple action.  In these cases, usually the Hithpael stem functions as the reflexive sense of the *Qal* (or perhaps Niphal) stem rather than the *Piel* stem.  This is the case with the verb אָבַל ("to mourn"), as shown in the example below.  Secondly, the Hithpael stem can also express simple action of a verb that is reflexive by its very nature.  In these rare cases, usually the verb appears *only* in the Hithpael stem in Biblical Hebrew. This is the case with the verb אָפַק ("to constrain oneself"), as shown in the example below.

### Expresses various other kinds of verbal action
Sometimes the Hithpael form functions in ways that do not follow the strictly the reflexive conventions of the Hithpael stem as listed above. Some verbs use the Hithpael stem to describe reciprocal action, middle action, passive action, and/or perhaps even stative or other kinds of verbal action. A dictionary or lexicon will indicate the correct meaning in these instances of the Hithpael stem. 

* GEN 42:1 –– expressing reciprocal action

<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>לָ֫מָּה תִּתְרָאוּ׃</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>lammah tithra'u</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>Why do you look at each other?</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Why do you look at one another?</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

* PRO 31:30 –– expressing passive (or possibly stative) action
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>הִיא הִתְהַלָּל׃</td>

<tr class="row-even"><td>hi hithhallal</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>she will be praised.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>she will be praised.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

* GEN 3:?? –– the Hithpael form of the verb הָלַךְ expresses *reciprocating* action (meaning, *going back and forth*)
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>אוּלַי֙ חָטְא֣וּ בָנַ֔י וּבֵרֲכ֥וּ אֱלֹהִ֖ים בִּלְבָבָ֑ם</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>'ulay hot'u vanay uverakhu 'elohim bilvavam</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>perhaps they have sinned my sons **and they have blessed** God in their hearts</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Perhaps my children have sinned **and cursed** God in their hearts.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

* DEU 1:37 –– the Hithpael form of the verb אָנַף ("to be angry") is always used in reference to Yahweh
