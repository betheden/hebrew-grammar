The sequential perfect form looks very similar to the normal perfect form, but it is a completely separate verbal form and must be treated as such. The sequential perfect form takes the same verbal endings as the perfect form but includes the conjunction *waw* as a prefix. A sequential perfect verb looks like a perfect verb with a conjunction, but it acts more like an *imperfect* verb connected to the clause before it to form a sequence. Sequential perfect verbs often appear in a chain following an imperfect verb.

**NOTE: There is a difference between (1) the sequential perfect form, (2) a normal perfect form with the conjunction, and (3) a normal imperfect form with a conjunction.** #1 and #2 look identical, so the reader must determine which one is being used in the text by examining the accent pattern, the context, or both.  The sequential perfect form (#1 above) is usually accented on the final syllable, but the perfect form with the conjunction (#2 above) has the accent moved forward within the word (usually to the next-to-last syllable). #1 is also different than #3, although they can have similar meanings.  The sequential perfect verb (#1 above) forms a sequence with the verb in the clause before it, but the normal imperfect form (#3 above) with the conjunction does not. In Biblical Hebrew, #1 is used much more frequently than either #2 or #3.
