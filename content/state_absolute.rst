State Absolute
==============

Summary
-------

The absolute state is the standard form of a word (noun, adjective, participle, or infinitive) in contrast to a modified form
called the construct state.  A word in the absolute state can take a prefix but not a suffix.

Article
-------

:ref:`Nouns<noun>`, :ref:`adjectives<adjective>`, :ref:`participles<participle_active>` and
:ref:`infinitives<infinitive_absolute>` can appear in either the absolute state or the :ref:`construct state<state_construct>`.
The absolute state is the standard form and consists of a longer ending as opposed to the shorter construct ending.  The most fundamental
difference between the two forms is that the construct form can take an attached :ref:`suffix<suffix>`, but the absolute form
cannot. Nouns, adjectives and participles can appear in either the absolute or the construct state for both 
:ref:`masculine<gender_masculine>` and :ref:`feminine<gender_feminine>` terms in both singular and plural forms. Because
infinitives do not change form for either gender or number, there isusually only one
:ref:`infinitive construct<infinitive_construct>` form and one :ref:`infinitive absolute<infinitive_absolute>`
form of a verb in Biblical Hebrew.

.. note:: Many masculine singular nouns appear exactly alike in both the absolute state and the construct state.

Examples

Standing alone
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Biblical Hebrew, when a term stands alone and is not grammatically connected to another word, it appears in the absolute
state.  This category includes terms such as a subject/object of a verb or
relative phrase, adjectives, adverbial nouns, etc. 

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 1:1

  בָּרָ֣א **אֱלֹהִ֑ים** אֵ֥ת **הַשָּׁמַ֖יִם** וְאֵ֥ת **הָאָֽרֶץ**\ ׃
  bara **'elohim** 'eth **hashamayim** we'eth **ha'arets**
  "he-created **God** [dir.obj] **the-heavens** and-[dir.obj]
     **the-earth**."
  **God** created **the heavens** and **the earth**.
   
   
Appearing with a prefix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The absolute state cannot take a suffix but can take a prefix, including a conjunction, preposition, definite article, or
even a relative particle. For example, a term functioning as the object of a preposition can appear in the absolute state with
a prefixed preposition, provided that there is no pronominal suffix.  A term with both a prefixed preposition and a pronominal
suffix would necessarily appear in the construct state.

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 1:1

  בָּרָ֣א **אֱלֹהִ֑ים** אֵ֥ת **הַשָּׁמַ֖יִם** וְאֵ֥ת **הָאָֽרֶץ**\ ׃
  bara **'elohim** 'eth **hashamayim** we'eth **ha'arets**
  "he-created **God** [dir.obj] **the-heavens** and-[dir.obj]
     **the-earth**."
  **God** created **the heavens** and **the earth**.

Concluding term of a :ref:`construct chain<state_construct-construct-chain>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The final word in a construct chain always appears in the absolute state either with or without the definite article.  This term is
often called the "absolute noun."  If the absolute noun in a construct chain is :ref:`definite<definiteness>`, then the
entire construct chain is definite.  If the absolute noun is indefinite, then the entire construct chain is indefinite.
