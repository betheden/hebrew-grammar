Stem Hophal
===========

Summary
-------

The Hophal stem is the passive form of the Hiphil, and it generally
expresses the passive voice of the meaning of a verb in the Hiphil stem.

The Hophal
:ref:`stem`
is the passive form of the
:ref:`stem_hiphil`
stem formation in Biblical Hebrew. The Hophal stem is usually indicated
by either a הָ or הֻ prefix to the
:ref:`verb`.
(The ה changes in the
:ref:`participle_active`
and :ref:`verb_imperfect`
forms.) The Hophal stem usually expresses the passive voice of the
meaning of a verb in the Hiphil stem. Scholars sometimes disagree
whether certain verb forms should be classified as belonging to the
Hophal, the
:ref:`stem_pual`
or even the :ref:`stem_qal_passive`
stem. In English, passive voice is expressed using the helping verb "to
be." In Biblical Hebrew, the passive nature of the verbal action is
expressed by the Hophal form of the verb itself without any helping
verbs.

.. note:: every form in the Hophal can have either a qamets hatuf or a
          qibbuts under the first letter (so הָ or הֻ). Here the qamets hatuf is
          used throughout.

Function
--------

The Hophal stem can express any of the following kinds of verbal action:

Expresses the passive voice of the Hiphil stem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For most verbs that appear in Hiphil stem in Biblical Hebrew, the Hophal
stem expresses the same kind of simple or causative action as the Hiphil
stem, but in passive voice. A good example is the verb בּוֹא. In the
:ref:`stem_qal`,
the verb בּוֹא means "to come" or "to go" (simple action, active voice).
But in the Hiphil stem, the verb בּוֹא means "to bring" (causative
action, active voice). Thus, in the Hophal stem, the verb בּוֹא means
"to be brought" (causative action, passive voice).

The Hophal stem of בּוֹא, meaning "to be brought"; in the
Hiphil stem, means "to bring", for example:

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 33:11

  קַח־נָ֤א אֶת־בִּרְכָתִי֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר **הֻבָ֣את** לָ֔ךְ
  qah-na 'eth-birkhathiy 'asher **huvath** lakh
  Take\_please [dir.obj]\_my-blessing that **it-was-brought** to-you
  Please accept my gift that **was brought** to you

The Hophal stem of נָגַד, meaning "to be declared"; in the
Hiphil stem, means "to declare", for example:

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 22:20

  וַיֻּגַּ֥ד לְאַבְרָהָ֖ם
  **wayyuggad** le'avraham
  **and-it-was-reported** to Abraham
  Abraham **was told**

Expresses simple action in passive voice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some verbs use the Hophal stem to express simple passive action. (This
can be true even if the verb also appears in the Hiphil stem in Biblical
Hebrew; in such cases, the Hophal form does NOT function strictly as a
passive of the Hiphil stem.) A good example is the verb יָצַק. In the
Qal stem, the verb יָצַק expresses the simple action "to pour" or "to
pour out". In the Hiphil stem, the verb יָצַק expresses the same simple
action "to pour". In the Hophal stem, the verb יָצַק expresses the
simple passive "to be poured" (that is, the passive of both the *Qal*
stem and the *Hiphil* stem). For some verbs, the Hophal and/or Pual
forms can both function as a passive of the Qal stem. In all these
cases, a dictionary or lexicon will indicate the correct meaning.

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 4:26 –– the Hophal stem of יָצַק ("to pour") means "to be poured"

  ה֣וּצַק חֵ֭ן בְּשְׂפְתוֹתֶ֑יךָ
  **hutsaq** hen besfethotheykha
  **it-is-poured-out** grace by-your-lips
  grace **is poured** onto your lips

Expresses various kinds of passive or stative action
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes the Pual form is used with specific verbs or in specific
contexts to express a specialized meaning for the verbal action. A
dictionary or lexicon will indicate the correct meaning.

The Hophal stem of the verb יָלַד ("to give birth")
refers to someone's birthday, for example:

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 40:20

  וַיְהִ֣י׀ בַּיּ֣וֹם הַשְּׁלִישִׁ֗י י֚וֹם **הֻלֶּ֣דֶת** אֶת־פַּרְעֹ֔ה
  wayhi bayyom hashelishi yom **hulledeth** 'eth-par'oh
  "and-it-happened in-the-day the-third day-of **having-been-born**
     [dir.obj]\_Pharaoh"
  It came about on the third day that it was Pharaoh's **birth**\ day.

The Hophal stem of the verb יָסַד ("to found, establish")
refers to the foundation of a building, for example:

.. csv-table:: Example: 2CH 3:3

  וְאֵ֙לֶּה֙ **הוּסַ֣ד** שְׁלֹמֹ֔ה לִבְנ֖וֹת אֶת־בֵּ֣ית הָאֱלֹהִ֑ים
  we'elleh **husad** shelomoh livnoth 'eth-beth ha'elohim
  "and-these **being-founded-of** Solomon to-build [dir.obj]\_house-of
     the-God"
  "Now these are the dimensions **of the foundation** that Solomon laid
     for the house of God."
