# conjunction Article
There are four main conjunctions in Hebrew.

## ו

Hebrew sentences often start with a ו. Usually this does not need to be translated.

Co-ordinative


Co-ordinative conjunctions are broader than just "and", they include all types of conjuctions that function to join two equal and indpendent parts. This would include the "copulative", "disjunctive", the "adversative", the "alternative", and the "explicative" use.
????????????????

* “and”

????????????This should be under the heading of "copulative" or "additive" conjuction.???????


* GEN 1:5

Disjunctive 

* “and” connects two opposite ideas

* GEN 2:17

Adversative 

* “but”

* GEN 6:8

Alternative

* “or”

* EXO 20:10

Explicative

* “even”

* GEN 4:4

Circumstantial 
???????????This should be under the heading of "subordinal conjunctions", as it joins an independent with a subordinate clause.????????

* “while,” “when”

* GEN 45:14

Unlike the other conjunctions, the ו cannot "stand alone", but has to be connected to another word as a prefix. This can be a noun, a verb, a pronoun, or a particle.

In front of a direct object marker: 1SA 25:11 וְלָקַחְתִּ֤י אֶת־לַחְמִי֙ וְאֶת־מֵימַ֔י‮a‬ וְאֵת֙ טִבְחָתִ֔י I will take my bread and my water and my meat. (note: when describing a list, Hebrew often adds the conjunction between every item on the list. In English this does not always have to be translated).

In front of a noun: 2KI 7:8 כֶּ֤סֶף וְזָהָב֙ silver and gold.

In front of a participle: ZEC 3:3 וְעֹמֵ֖ד לִפְנֵ֥י הַמַּלְאָֽךְ‬ and he was standing in front of the angel.

In front of an infinitive absolute: GEN 41:43 וְנָתֹ֣ון אֹתֹ֔ו עַ֖ל כָּל־אֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרָֽיִם׃ and he set him over the whole land of Egypt.

In front of a personal pronoun: ISA 49:4 וַאֲנִ֤י אָמַ֨רְתִּי֙ and I said.

Take note: most verbs that have a ו prefix are not conjunctions, but form a consecutive form of the perfect or imperfect.
