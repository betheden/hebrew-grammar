# conjunction Article
Biblical Hebrew contains only one primary conjunction (the prefix וְ), but a whole family of other words also function as conjunctions. A conjunction is a word that shows a relationship between two different things within a text; these "things" can be individual words or phrases, or even entire sentences or paragraphs. In Biblical Hebrew, particles are often combined with each other to form compound conjunctions. Compound conjunctions should not be considered merely as the sum of the components, but rather as a single grammatical entity with its own range of meanings which may or may not be different than the individual component words.  

## -וְ

Sentences in Biblical Hebrew often begin with the conjunction ו (as either a consonant or a shureq vowel).  This conjunction וְ ("and") cannot stand alone as an independent word but must be connected to another word as a prefix. This can be added to a [noun](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/noun/02.md), a [verb](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/verb/02.md), a [pronoun](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/pronoun/02.md), or a [particle](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/particle/02.md). The shewa in וְ can lengthen to a vowel, usually pathah (when paired with the definite article) or qamets (when paired with both the article and a ה prefix), but others are also possible.

NOTE: This conjunction is often left untranslated when it begins a sentence or clause, or when it appears within the sequential verbal forms ([Sequential Suffix Conjugation](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/verb_sequential_perfect/02.md) and [Sequential Prefix Conjugation](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/verb_sequential_imperfect/02.md)). Also, the conjunction is often added between every item of a list in Biblical Hebrew; but in English the וְ is not translated for each item.

### Form

The conjunction וְ can appear either as a prefix to a word or particle, or as part of a sequential verbal form.

## כִּי
[NOTE: כִּי is one of the most flexible words in Biblical Hebrew in terms of its meaning. It can function either as a conjunction or as a particle, with many different potential meanings. If in doubt, it is recommended to *always* consult a dictionary or lexicon to confirm how the word is being used in any specific instance.]

The word כִּי is the standard causal conjunction in Biblical Hebrew, and is usually translated as "for" in English. However, it is also commonly used as a conditional conjunction (usually translated, "if").  Often, כִּי is conditional when it occurs at the beginning of a sentence and causal when it occurs in the middle (or toward the end) of a sentence, but there are notable exceptions to this general rule. 

### Causal

This is the most common use of the word כִּי. However, sometimes it is extremely difficult to distinguish between a causal conjunction that expresses purpose and one that expresses result.  When כִּי functions as a causal conjunction, it is often translated into English simply as "for", which can express either purpose or result. 

#### Expresses purpose
This means to express the purpose, reason, or cause for an action/event. In English, this kind of causal conjunction is usually translated as "for" or "because". 

* GEN 3:14
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd" align="right"><td>וַיֹּאמֶר֩ יְהֹוָ֨ה אֱלֹהִ֥ים ׀ אֶֽל־הַנָּחָשׁ֮ **כִּ֣י** עָשִׂ֣יתָ זֹּאת֒ אָר֤וּר אַתָּה֙׃</td>

</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Then Yahweh God said to the snake, "**Because** you did this, I will curse you</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

#### Expresses result
This means to express the result or intended outcome of an action/event. In English, this kind of causal conjunction is usually translated as "for" or “so that”.

* GEN 20:10
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd" align="right"><td>מָ֣ה רָאִ֔יתָ **כִּ֥י** עָשִׂ֖יתָ אֶת־הַדָּבָ֥ר הַזֶּֽה׃</td>

</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>What prompted you **to** do this thing?</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Conditional

This is also a very common use of the word כִּי in Biblical Hebrew. This conjunction can describe either a hypothetical condition or an actual condition, as determined by the context.

#### Expresses a hypothetical condition
A hypothetical condition expresses an imaginary action or event that has not actually happened in reality. This kind of conditional conjunction is usually translated as "if" in English. Hypothetical conditions have potential to convey many different nuances of possibility and/or desirability.

</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>**If** you meet any man, do not greet him, and **if** anyone greets you, do not answer him.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

#### Expresses an actual condition
An actual condition expresses an action or event that has actually happened in reality, and is usually translated as "when" or "while" in English.  Usually, this kind of condition indicates something that is happening concurrently with the main action/event being described, or something that has happened in the past in certain circumstances.

</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>**When** Isaac was old and his eyes were dim so that he could not see</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Other uses
The word כִּי can also express other conjunctive meanings, often as an adversative following a negated statement.  If in doubt, it is recommended to always consult a dictionary or lexicon for the exact meaning of the word in any specific instance.

## אִם

NOTE: Like the word כִּי, the word אִם in Biblical Hebrew is also extremely flexible in its meaning. If in doubt, it is recommended to always consult a dictionary or lexicon for the exact meaning of the word in any specific instance.

### Conditional

The word אִם is the standard conditional conjunction in Biblical Hebrew.  It is most often used to describe a hypothetical condition and translated as "if" in English. However, this term can can be nuanced and translated in a variety of specific ways, and it can be joined with various other particles to form different compound conjunctions.  Therefore, this word must be translated always with senstivity to the context to express the correct nuance.

## וְעַתָּה

The word עַתָּה ("now") in Biblical Hebrew often functions as an adverb in a sentence. However, when עַתָּה appears at the beginning of a sentence or clause, it usually functions not as an adverb but as a conjunction, either standing alone or as a compound conjunction (when paired with the prefix וְ or with particles such as גַּם or כִּי). In either case, the term functions as a causal conjunction, indicating that what follows is based upon what has come before. This conjunction must be translated always with great sensitivity to the context to express the correct nuance; in English, this conjunction can be translated as "now", "so", "so now", "and now", "therefore", and others. A dictionary or lexicon will indicate the specific nuance of this term in individual contexts.

## לֽוּ
This term is a conditional conjunction, similar to אִם but used only to express hypothetical conditions. The word can also appear in the alternate forms לוּא and לֻא.  This conjunction either: 1) expresses a condition that cannot (or probably will not) happen, usually translated "if" in English; or 2) conveys a strong desire for something to happen that cannot (or probably will not) be realized, usually translated "if only" in English.

## פֶּן
This term is also a conditional conjunction, and it expresses a certain kind of hypothetical condition. The word can be used in two different ways: either 1) in warnings to express a potential condition that will take place if the warning is not heeded, usually translated "lest" in English; or 2) to express the reason for a certain action to prevent a possible condition from taking place, usually translated as "so that...not" (or similar phrasing) in English.

### אַף כִּי 

Sometimes the words אַף and כִּי are paired together to form a compound conjunction that functions much like an [ַaffirmation particle](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/particle_affirmation/02.md), conveying a strong sense of affirmation or addition. This compound conjunction can appear with or without the prefix conjunction וְ ("and").

NOTE: Like other particles, the words אַף and כִּי sometimes appear together but do NOT form a compound conjunction; in such cases, each word retains its individual meaning, usually as an affirmation particle (אַף) and a conditional conjunction (כִּי). These instances must be determined from the context.  If in doubt, consult a dictionary or lexicon for the exact meaning of any specific occurrence.
