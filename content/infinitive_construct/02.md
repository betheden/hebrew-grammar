# infinitive_construct Article
The infinitive construct may have a suffixed pronoun. Context will tell if the pronoun is subjective or objective. For example, in JER 2:17 עזבך את-יהוה the pronoun is doing the action, “your abandoning YHWH.” But in RUT 1:16 לעזבל לשוב מאחריך the pronoun is receiving the action, “to abandon you, to turn from following you.”
