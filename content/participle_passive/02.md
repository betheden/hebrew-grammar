# participle_passive Article
Properly speaking, participles in Biblical Hebrew are verbal nouns. They conjugate in the passive stems (Qal passive, Niphal, Pual, Hophal, etc.) like the infinitive forms.  They also inflect for person and gender like both adjectives and nouns.  Furthermore, they can also appear in either the absolute state or the construct state, like nouns.  Thus, participles have potential to function as a verbal complement, a finite verb, an adjective, or a noun.  In most cases, the context will clearly show how the participle is being used in the sentence.  Generally speaking, the meaning of the participle is clear even in cases where its specific grammatical function cannot be determined precisely.  

NOTE: Only the Qal stem has a distinct passive form for the participle; in all other cases, the passive meaning is determined by the stem itself.

## Function
Passive participles are generally used as an independent grammatical entity, although they can introduce relative clauses, like active participles.  Generally speaking, passive participles are limited in meaning than active participles, usually functioning descriptively or expressing stative actions.  Passive participles are governed either by the main verb of a sentence or by the context; thus, they can express action in past time, present time, future time, or without any specified timeframe.

The passive participle can function in a sentence in any of the following ways:


#### Functions as a verbal adjective
This is the most common use of the passive participle in Biblical Hebrew.  When a passive participle functions as an adjective, it is usually either an attributive adjective or a predicate adjective.  The context must determine whether a passive participle is functioning as a predicate adjective or as a finite verb, because both appear the same in many instances (compare EXO 5:16 and 1SA 19:11).

#### Functions as a finite verb
The context must determine whether a passive participle is functioning as a finite verb or as a predicate adjective, because both appear the same in many instances (compare 1SA 19:11 and EXO 5:16).
