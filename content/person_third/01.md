# person_third Glossary
Third person is used when the narrator or speaker refers to someone besides himself or the reader or listener. Third person uses pronouns such as "he," "she," "they," "him," "her," or "them." Hebrew does not always use a pronoun since the verb suffix or prefix can show its subject.
