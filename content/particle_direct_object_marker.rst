Particle Direct Object Marker
=============================

Summary
-------

This particle precedes the noun that functions as the direct object of a
verb.

Article
-------

As the name suggests, this particle indicates the direct object of some
verb. It does this by directly preceding the
:ref:`noun`
or phrase that functions as the direct object of a finite or non-finite
:ref:`verb`.
The direct object marker does not occur before *every* direct object,
but it usually appears in places where there might be confusion. Thus,
grammatically speaking, the direct object marker is optional in Biblical
Hebrew. Many languages, including English, do not have any specific word
or written symbol that serves a similar function. Therefore, this
particle is usually not translated.

The standard form of the direct object marker is אֵת. It can take both
the attached
:ref:`conjunction`
(i.e. the *waw* prefix, "and") and/or a :ref:`suffix_pronominal`.

.. note:: the direct object marker is easily confused with the preposition
          אֵת ("with") which has an identical standard form. When taking a
          pronominal suffix, however, the two words can be distinguished by the
          vowel they each select. The direct object marker takes a holem/holem-waw
          vowel with an attached suffix (אוֹתִי or אֹתִי), whereas the preposition
          takes a hireq vowel (אִתִּי) with an attached suffix.
