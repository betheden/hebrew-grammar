Function
--------

In Biblical Hebrew, it is helpful to classify participles according to
their function in the sentence as a whole: as a
:ref:`verb`
(or verbal complement); as an 
:ref:`adjective`; 
or as a 
:ref:`noun`. 
Participles can
function independently as their own grammatical entity, but they often
introduce entire clauses that function either as adjectives or nouns.
When used verbally, the active participle is closely related in meaning
to the 
:ref:`verb_imperfect` 
verb; they are both often used to describe continuous or repeating action and can function as either a
:ref:`verb-non-finite`
verbal complement or a 
:ref:`verb-finite` 
verb.

functions as a :ref:`verb-non-finite` verbal complement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When functioning as a verbal complement, the participle is governed by
the main verb of the sentence and has potential to be translated as past
time, present time, or future time. A verbal participle can express
continuous, imminent, habitual, or even stative action as determined by the
context.

.. note:: The subject of a verbal participle usually
          precedes the participle, in contrast to the normal conventions of
          :ref:`word_order`.

.. csv-table:: Example: HOS 2:10 –– expressing stative action

  "יָעַ֥צְתָּ בֹּ֖שֶׁת לְבֵיתֶ֑ךָ קְצוֹת־עַמִּ֥ים רַבִּ֖ים **וְחוֹטֵ֥א**
     נַפְשֶֽׁךָ"
  "ya'atsta bosheth levethekha qetsoth-'ammim rabbim **wehote**
     nafshekha"
  "you-have-devised shame to-your-house cutting-off\_peoples many
     **and-making-guilty** your-soul"
  "You have devised shame for your house by cutting off many people,
     **and have sinned** against yourself"

.. csv-table:: Example: 1SA 28:14 –– expressing simple durative action

  "עוֹדֶ֖נּוּ **מְדַבֵּ֣ר** עִמָּ֑ם וְרָחֵ֣ל׀ בָּ֗אָה עִם־הַצֹּאן֙
     אֲשֶׁ֣ר לְאָבִ֔יהָ"
  'odennu **medabber** 'immam werahel ba'ah 'im-hatson 'asher le'aviha
  "still-he **was-speaking** with-them and-Rachel came with\_the-sheep
     that to-her-father"
  "While Jacob **was** still **speaking** with them, Rachel came with
     her father's sheep,"

.. csv-table:: Example: NEH 1:4 –– two participles paired with finite verb היה

  וָֽאֱהִ֥י **צָם֙ וּמִתְפַּלֵּ֔ל** לִפְנֵ֖י אֱלֹהֵ֥י הַשָּׁמָֽיִם
  wa'ehi **tsam umithpallel** lifne 'elohe hashamayim
  and-I-was **fasting and-praying** before God-of the-heavens
  I **was fasting and praying** before the God of heaven.

functions as a :ref:`verb-finite` main verb
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When functioning as a main verb, the participle is governed by the context
and has the potential to be translated as past time, present time,
future time, or even without a specified timeframe. A verbal participle
can express continuous, imminent, habitual, or even stative action as
determined by the context.

.. note:: The subject of a verbal participle usually
          precedes the participle, in contrast to the normal conventions of
          :ref:`word_order`.

.. csv-table:: Example: 1SA 3:8 –– expressing frequentive action

  וַיָּ֣בֶן עֵלִ֔י כִּ֥י יְהוָ֖ה **קֹרֵ֥א** לַנָּֽעַר
  wayyaven 'eli ki yehwah **qore** lanna'ar
  and-he-understood Eli that Yahweh **was-calling** to-the-boy
  Then Eli realized that Yahweh **had called** the boy.

.. csv-table:: Example: 1SA 28:14 –– expressing simple durative action

  וַתֹּ֗אמֶר אִ֤ישׁ זָקֵן֙ עֹלֶ֔ה
  wattomer 'ish zaqen **'oleh**
  and-she-said man old **is-going-up**
  "She said, ""An old man **is coming up**"

.. csv-table:: Example: 1SA 3:11 –– expressing imminent action

  הִנֵּ֧ה אָנֹכִ֛י **עֹשֶׂ֥ה** דָבָ֖ר בְּיִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל
  hinneh 'anokhi **'oseh** davar beyisra'el
  Behold I **am-doing** thing in-Israel
  "See, I **am about to do** something in Israel"

functions as an :ref:`adjective`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When functioning as an adjective, a participle immediately follows the noun it describes, and matches that noun in gender, number, and definiteness.
The participle can either function as an adjective by itself or
introduce an entire clause that functions as an adjective.

.. csv-table:: Example: DEU 4:24 –– a participle functioning by itself as an adjective

  כִּ֚י יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ אֵ֥שׁ אֹכְלָ֖ה
  ki yehwah 'eloheykha 'esh **'okhelah**
  for Yahweh your-God fire **eating**
  For Yahweh your God is a **devouring** fire

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 1:12 –– a participle introducing a clause functioning as an
   adjective

  "וַתּוֹצֵ֨א הָאָ֜רֶץ דֶּ֠שֶׁא עֵ֣שֶׂב **מַזְרִ֤יעַ** זֶ֙רַע֙
     לְמִינֵ֔הוּ"
  wattotse ha'arets deshe 'esev **mazria'** zera' leminehu
  "and-it-sprouted-forth the-earth grass crops **yielding** seed
     to-its-kind"
  "The earth produced vegetation, plants **producing** seed after their
     kind"

functions as a :ref:`noun`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When functioning as a noun, a participle will often take the
:ref:`particle_definite_article`
(but not always). The participle can either function as a noun by itself
or introduce an entire clause that functions as a noun.  A participle will appear in the
:ref:`state_construct`
either when it takes a 
:ref:`suffix_pronominal`
or when it is in a construct relationship with another noun in the
:ref:`state_absolute`.

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 1:30 –– a participle functioning by itself as a noun

  וּלְכֹ֣ל׀ **רוֹמֵ֣שׂ** עַל־הָאָ֗רֶץ
  ulekhol **romes** 'al-ha'arets
  and-to-all **crawlers** on\_the-earth
  and to everything **that creeps** upon the earth

.. csv-table:: Example:  GEN 26:11 –– a participle introducing a relative clause functioning
   as a noun

  הַנֹּגֵ֜עַ בָּאִ֥ישׁ הַזֶּ֛ה וּבְאִשְׁתּ֖וֹ מ֥וֹת יוּמָֽת
  **hannogea'** ba'ish hazzeh uve'ishto moth yumath
  "**the-one-touching** in-the-man the-this and-in-his-wife dying
     he-will-be-made-dead"
  **Whoever touches** this man or his wife will surely be put to death.
