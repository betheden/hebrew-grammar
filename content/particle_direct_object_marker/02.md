# particle_direct_object_marker Article

## Form
The standard form of the direct object marker is אֵת. It can take both a [conjunction](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/conjunction/02.md), the waw-prefix (and), and a [pronominal suffix](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/suffix_pronominal/02.md). It precedes the direct object of a sentence or frase and is sometimes connected to it with a maqef.

Take note: the direct object marker is easily confused with the preposition אֶת (with) which has an identical form.

## Function
As the name suggests, the direct object marker marks the direct object. It does do by preceding the [noun](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/noun/02.md) that is the direct object of a [verb](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/verb/02.md).

The direct object marker does not occur before every direct object, but only when the writer wants to avoid confusion, or perhaps as a stylistic feature. Hence the direct object marker is essentially optional.

Many languages, including English, do not have a word or written symbol that fulfils a similar function, and is therefore often not translated.

### Before a noun

<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd" align="right"><td>בָּרָ֣א אֱלֹהִ֑ים **אֵ֥ת** הַשָּׁמַ֖יִם **וְאֵ֥ת** הָאָֽרֶץ׃</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>ara 'elohim **'eth** hashamayim **we'eth** ha'arets</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>he created God **[direct object marker]** the heavens **and [direct object marker]** the earth</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>God created the heavens and the earth</td>
</tr>

Perhaps the direct object marker is used to make extra sure that the reader understands that the heavens and the earth are both created and are not creating forces themselves.

### With a [pronominal suffix](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/suffix_pronominal/02.md)
