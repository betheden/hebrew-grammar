Adjective Gentilic
==================

Summary
-------

In Biblical Hebrew, the name(s) of spoken language(s) are considered gentilic adjectives.  

Article
-------

The names of spoken languages are the only terms that are considered by this grammar as proper "gentilic adjectives".
However, Hebrew scholars disagree concerning which terms should be called gentilic nouns or gentilic adjectives.  This is
because most gentilics in Biblical Hebrew can legitimately be classified as either nouns or adjectives.  

.. note:: Some :ref:`gentilic nouns<noun_gentilic>` that follow nouns in the
  absolute state function like :ref:`attributive adjectives<adjective-attributive>`.
  Some scholars call these gentilic adjectives as well (for example, "Ruth the Moabitess").
