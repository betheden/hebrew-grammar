expresses the passive voice of the Polel stem.

Article
-------

The Polal stem is a variation of the :ref:`stem_pual`
and expresses the passive voice of the verbal action of the :ref:`stem_polel`.
The Polal stem is formed from the Pual by dropping the 2nd radical and
repeating the 3rd radical (with a vowel change). It is an extremely rare
verbal form in Biblical Hebrew.

.. warning:: The Polal stem appears exactly the same as the Polel stem in all
          conjugations; only the 3rd-person masculine singular forms are
          different.
