Noun
====

Summary
-------

A noun is a person, a thing, a place, or an idea.

Article
-------

Every noun also has a number, which can be
:ref:`number_plural`,
or
:ref:`number_dual`.
It also has a state, which can be
:ref:`state_construct`
or
:ref:`state_absolute`.
The dictionary form is singular absolute. Nouns can also have a variety
of prefixes and
:ref:`suffix`
that give extra information.

The form of the noun often, but not always, indicates its gender, which
can be
:ref:`gender_masculine`
or
:ref:`gender_feminine`.

Sometimes an adjective
(:ref:`adjective-substantive`)
or a participle
(:ref:`participle_active`, :ref:`participle_passive`)
can function like a noun.

In Hebrew, nouns do not change their form based on the function (or
case) they have in a sentence (subject/nominative, direct
object/accusative, etc.). They only change if they are in :ref:`state_construct`.
