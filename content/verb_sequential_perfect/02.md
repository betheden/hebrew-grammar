# verb_sequential_perfect Article
The sequential perfect form looks very similar to the normal perfect form, but it is a completely separate verbal form and must be treated as such. The sequential perfect form takes the same verbal endings as the perfect form but includes the conjunction *waw* as a prefix. A sequential perfect verb looks like a perfect verb with the conjunction, but it does not function that way. Rather, it acts like an *imperfect* verb, but with an added sense of progression.  Thus, a sequential perfect verb is connected to some earlier verb to form a sequence, either a sequence of time or a sequence of thought. Sequential perfect verbs often appear in a series following a clause with an imperfect verb.

**NOTE: There is a difference between (1) the sequential perfect form, (2) a normal perfect form with the conjunction, and (3) a normal imperfect form with a conjunction.** (1) and (2) look identical, so the reader must determine which one is being used in the text by examining the accent pattern, the context, or both.  The sequential perfect form [(1) above] is usually accented on the final syllable, but the perfect form with the conjunction [(2) above] has the accent moved forward within the word (usually to the next-to-last syllable). (1) is also different than (3), although they can have similar meanings.  The sequential perfect verb [(1) above] forms a sequence with the verb in the clause before it, but the normal imperfect form [(3) above] with the conjunction does not. In Biblical Hebrew, (1) is used much more frequently than either (2) or (3).

The sequential perfect form can indicate any one of many different kinds of actions:

#### **1) Future actions**
1 Sam 17:32 –  עַבְדְּךָ֣ יֵלֵ֔ךְ וְנִלְחַ֖ם  "... Your servant will go ***and fight*** ..."
    
#### **2) Incomplete actions**

#### **3) Habitual actions**
1 Sam 2:19 –  וּמְעִ֤יל קָטֹן֙ תַּעֲשֶׂה־לּ֣וֹ אִמּ֔וֹ וְהַעַלְתָ֥ה ל֖וֹ מִיָּמִ֣ים  "And his mother would make him a little coat ***and bring*** it to him every year ..."


#### **4) Commands or exhortations (similar to imperatives, jussives, or cohortatives)**
2 Sam 15:19 –  שׁ֣וּב וְשֵׁ֤ב עִם־הַמֶּ֙לֶךְ֙  "...Go back ***and stay*** with the king..." [imperative]

Gen 1:15 –  וְהָי֤וּ לִמְאוֹרֹת֙   "***And let them be*** as lights ..." [jussive]

Judg 19:13 –  וְנִקְרְבָ֖ה בְּאַחַ֣ד הַמְּקֹמ֑וֹת וְלַ֥נּוּ  "...Now let us draw near to one of these places ***and stay the night***..." [cohortative]


#### **5) Possible actions**
Gen 3:22 –  פֶּן־יִשְׁלַ֣ח יָד֗וֹ וְלָקַח֙  "... lest he should stretch out his hand ***and take*** ..."  


#### **6) Desirable actions**
1 Kin 8:30 –  וְשָׁ֨מַעְתָּ֜ אֶל־תְּחִנַּ֤ת עַבְדְּךָ֙  "***And hear*** the prayer of your servant ..."


#### **7) Conditional actions (and other actions without a specified timeframe)**
Gen 44:22 –  וְעָזַ֥ב אֶת־אָבִ֖יו וָמֵֽת׃  "***And if he should leave*** his father, ***then*** his father ***would die***..."
