# adjective Article
Adjectives always match the noun they describe in gender and number. Because the gender of some nouns does not match their form, the adjective matches the gender of the noun, not its form. If the noun is dual, the adjective will be plural. If a noun is collective or if a plural noun refers to one person, the adjective may match the implied number rather than the form. 

## 1. The adjective describes an attribute if 

-the adjective and the noun are both definite or both indefinite

-the adjective comes after the noun

* 1SA 18:17 
   
    * בִתִּ֨י הַגְּדוֹלָ֤ה
    

    * בִתִּי הַגְּדֹולָה 
    * my older daughter (literally, my daughter the older)

## 2. The adjective is connected to a noun with a linking verb if

-the adjective is indefinite

* 2SA 14:20
    
    * וַאדֹנִ֣י חָכָ֗ם  
    
    * and my lord is wise (literally, and my lord wise)

Therefore, if the adjective is indefinite and comes after the noun, it is not clear if it describes and attribute or is connected to a noun with a linking verb.

## 3. If there is no noun, the adjective acts like one. 

* PSA 3:2

    * רַ֝בִּ֗ים קָמִ֥ים עָלָֽי 
    
    * many people are rising up against me (literally, many are rising up against me)

## 4. Compare 2 nouns

To compare two nouns, מן  is used. It can mean “more.”

* JDG 14:18

    * מַה־מָּת֣וֹק מִדְּבַ֔שׁ וּמֶ֥ה עַ֖ז מֵאֲרִ֑י  
    
    * What is sweeter than honey, and what is stronger than a lion (literally, What sweet than honey, and what strong than lion)
    
## 5. Compare 3 or more nouns

-definite

* 1SA 16:11

    *  הַקָּטָ֔ן 

    * the youngest (literally, the young)

-if the next word has the prefix ב followed by a plural noun

* SNG 1:8 

    * הַיָּפָ֖ה בַּנָּשִׁ֑ים 

    * the fairest among women (literally, the fair among women)

-if the noun is in construct. Often the noun may be repeated, first as single, then plural. 

* EXO 26:33

    *  קֹ֥דֶשׁ הַקֳּדָשִֽׁים
    
    * the holiest place (literally, holy of the holies)

## The noun may also have a pronominal suffix

* MIC 7:4

    * טוֹבָ֣ם
    
    * the best of them (literally, their good)

## Divine epithet 

* JON 3:3 

    * עִיר־גְּדוֹלָה֙ לֵֽאלֹהִ֔ים
   
    * a very great city (literally, a city great to Elohim)

## מן כל

מן  compares two things, but מן כל compares many 

* GEN 3:1 

    * וְהַנָּחָשׁ֙ הָיָ֣ה עָר֔וּם מִכֹּל֙ חַיַּ֣ת הַשָּׂדֶ֔ה
    
    * the serpent was the most cunning of all the animals of the field

## מאד 

= “very” when it follows an adjective

* GEN 1:31

    * וְהִנֵּה־ט֖וֹב מְאֹ֑ד
    
    * and behold, it was very good (literally, and behold good very)
