# stem_qal_passive Article
The Qal passive stem is a [stem](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem/02.md) formation in Biblical Hebrew that expresses simple passive verbal action. There is some debate among scholars concerning all the [verbs](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/verb/02.md) that are parsed as Qal passives, because they could also be identified as either a [Pual](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_pual/02.md) or a [Hophal](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_hophal/02.md). This distinction is not important for meaning or translation.
