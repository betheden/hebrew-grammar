# verb_jussive Article
The jussive form looks very similar to the [prefix conjugation](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/verb_imperfect/02.md) but functions in the sentence more like an [imperative](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/verb_imperative/02.md). Jussive [verbs](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/verb/02.md) usually appear in [3rd person]([3rd person](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/person_third/02.md)) forms. (Similarly, imperatives appear only in [2nd person]([2nd person](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/person_second/02.md)) forms, and [cohortatives]([cohortatives](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/verb_cohortative/02.md)) appear only in [1st person]([1st person](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/person_fist/02.md)) forms.) A jussive verb does not carry the full force of a command ("He *must* do this!"), but it conveys a stronger meaning than a simple suggestion or statement of possibilty ("He *could* do this."). The meaning is somewhere in the middle. In English, a jussive is often translated with the helping verb "may" or "let," depending on the context ("*May* he do this!" or "*Let* him do this!"). Thus, the jussive verb functions as an indirect command; the reader must examine the context to determine the strength of desirability being expressed in each specific instance.

Biblical Hebrew does not use the imperative form to express negative commands. Rather, negative commands are always expressed using either the prefix conjugation or the jussive form. In cases where the jussive form is being used to express a negative command, the jussive will appear in a 2nd person form rather than a 3rd person form. When used in this way, the jussive form takes the [negative particle אַל](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/particle_negative/02.md) in nearly all instances.

The jussive form can indicate any of the following kinds of actions:
