Stem Pual
=========

Summary
-------

The Pual stem is the passive form of the Piel, and it generally
expresses the passive voice of the meaning of a verb in the Piel stem.

Article
-------

The Pual
:ref:`stem`
is the passive form of the :ref:`stem_piel`
formation in Biblical Hebrew. The Pual stem is usually indicated by a
daghesh in the middle consonsant of the
:ref:`verb`
and a qibbuts vowel under the first consonant. Generally speaking, the
Pual stem expresses the passive voice of the meaning of a verb in the
Piel stem. Scholars sometimes disagree whether certain verb forms should
be classified as belonging to the Pual stem or the :ref:`stem_qal_passive`.
In English, passive action is expressed using the helping verb "to be."
In Biblical Hebrew, the passive nature of the verbal action is expressed
by the Pual form of the verb itself without any helping verbs.

Function
~~~~~~~~

The Pual stem can express any of the following kinds of verbal action:

Expresses the passive voice of the Piel stem
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For most verbs that appear in both the Piel and Pual stems in Biblical
Hebrew, the Pual stem expresses the same kind of action as the Piel stem
(simple, intensive, resultative, causative, etc.) but in passive voice.
A good example is the verb בָּקַע. In the :ref:`stem_qal`,
the verb בָּקַע means "to cut open" or "to break open" (simple action,
active voice). But in the Piel stem, the verb בָּקַע means "to *rip*
open" (intensive action, active voice). Thus, in the Pual stem, the verb
בָּקַע means "to be ripped open" (intensive action, passive voice).

-  JOS 9:4 –– Pual stem of בָּקַע, meaning "to be ripped open"; in Piel
   stem, means "to rip open"

.. csv-table::

  "וַיִּקְח֞וּ ... וְנֹאד֥וֹת יַ֙יִן֙ בָּלִ֔ים **וּמְבֻקָּעִ֖ים**
     וּמְצֹרָרִֽים"
  wayyiqhu ... wenodoth yayin balim **umevuqqa'im** umetsorarim
  "and-they-took ... and-skins-of wine worn-out **and-ripped-open**
     and-repaired"
  "They also took old wine skins that were worn, **torn**, and had been
     repaired."

-  EZK 38:12 –– Pual stem of אָסַף, meaning "to be gathered"; in Piel
   stem, means "to gather"

.. csv-table::

  וְאֶל־עַם֙ **מְאֻסָּ֣ף** מִגּוֹיִ֔ם
  we'el-'am **me'ussaf** miggoyim
  and-to\_people **being-gathered** from-nations
  and against the people **gathered** from the nations

Expresses simple action in passive voice
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some verbs use the Pual stem to express simple action in passive voice
(rather than the :ref:`stem_niphal`).
This can be true even if the verb also appears in the Piel stem in
Biblical Hebrew; in such cases, the Pual form does NOT function as a
passive of the Piel stem. A good example is the verb יָלַד. In the Qal
stem, the verb יָלַד expresses the simple action "to give birth". In the
Piel stem, the verb יָלַד expresses the causative action "to cause to
give birth" (meaning, *to serve as a midwife*). But in the Pual stem,
the verb יָלַד expresses the simple passive "to be born" (that is, the
passive of the *Qal* stem rather the *Piel* stem).

-  GEN 4:26 –– the Pual stem of יָלַד ("to give birth") means "to be
   born"

.. csv-table::

  וּלְשֵׁ֤ת גַּם־הוּא֙ **יֻלַּד**\ ־בֵּ֔ן
  ulesheth gam-hu' **yullad**-ben
  and-to-Seth even\_him **was-born**\ \_son
  A son **was born** to Seth

Expresses various kinds of passive or stative action
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes the Pual form is used with specific verbs or in specific
contexts to express a specialized meaning for the verbal action. A
dictionary or lexicon will indicate the correct meaning in these rare
instances of the Pual stem.

-  EXO 3:2 –– in the Pual stem, the verb אָכַל ("to eat") means "to be
   consumed" by fire ֹor sword

.. csv-table::

  וְהִנֵּ֤ה הַסְּנֶה֙ בֹּעֵ֣ר בָּאֵ֔שׁ וְהַסְּנֶ֖ה אֵינֶ֥נּוּ אֻכָּֽל
  wehinneh hasseneh bo'er ba'esh wehasseneh 'enennu **'ukkal**
  "and-behold the-bush was-burning in-the-fire and-the-bush was-not
     **being-consumed**"
  "and behold, the bush was burning, but the bush was not **burned up**"

-  GEN 15:9 –– the Pual form of the verb שָׁלַשׁ means "to be three (years
   old)" or "to have three parts"

.. csv-table::

  "קְחָ֥ה לִי֙ עֶגְלָ֣ה **מְשֻׁלֶּ֔שֶׁת** וְעֵ֥ז **מְשֻׁלֶּ֖שֶׁת**
     וְאַ֣יִל מְשֻׁלָּ֑שׁ"
  "qehah liy 'eglah **meshullesheth** we'ez **meshullesheth** we'ayil
     **meshullash**"
  "Take to-me heifer **being-three** and-female-goat **being-three**
     and-ram **being-three**"
  "Bring me a heifer **three years old**, a female goat **three years
     old**, a ram **three years old**"

-  PSA 88:18 (PSA 88:19 in Hebrew) –– the Pual
   :ref:`participle_passive`
   of יָדַע ("to know") means an *acquaintance* (that is, "one who is
   known")

.. csv-table::

  מְֽיֻדָּעַ֥י מַחְשָֽׁךְ
  **meyudda'ay** mahshakh
  **one-who-is-known-to-me** darkness
