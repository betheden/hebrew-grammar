Pronoun Indefinite
==================

Summary
-------

An indefinite pronoun is a pronoun that refers to a person(s) or thing(s) in general but not to any specific person or thing in
particular.  In English, they are usually translated as "whoever” (in reference to persons) or "whatever" (when referring to
things).

Article
-------

Biblical Hebrew contains two indefinite pronouns, the pronoun מִי (in reference to persons) and the pronoun מָה
(in reference to things). These pronouns can also as :ref:`interrogative pronoun<pronoun_interrogative>`, especially when they
appear at the beginning of a clause/sentence. However, this is not a universal rule; the specific use of these pronouns must
always be determined from the context. Indefinite pronouns function in a sentence almost exactly like a
:ref:`relative pronoun<pronoun_relative>` (see examples below).

Form
----

Indefinite pronouns do not change their form based on number, gender, or person. However, the vowels can change depending on the
vocalization of the word immediately following the pronoun.
