Pronoun
=======

Summary
-------

A pronoun replaces a noun or noun phrase. For example, instead of
writing "the man" multiple times, the writer uses "he" to avoid
repeating the noun.

A pronoun is a word that, like a
:ref:`noun`,
refers to a person or a thing, but it does not have any meaning in
itself.

Types
-----

Hebraists usually identify five types of pronouns:
:ref:`pronoun_indefinite`,
:ref:`pronoun_personal`,
and
:ref:`pronoun_relative`.
