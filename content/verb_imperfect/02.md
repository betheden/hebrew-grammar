# verb_imperfect Article
**Generally speaking, in Biblical Hebrew the imperfect form is used to describe either actions that are not completed or actions that occurr in the present/future from the perspective of the writer/speaker.**  (This is in opposition to the perfect form, which is used to describe either actions that are completed or actions that occur in the past from the perspective of the writer/speaker.)  However, the imperfect form is also used to describe several other kinds of actions as determined by the context, including commands, potential actions/events, and desirable actions/events.  For this reason, **the reader must carefully examine the context of each instance of the imperfect form to ensure that the proper sense of the verb is understood as best as possible.**  This is especially true in Hebrew poetry.

**When the conjunction is added to the imperfect form as a prefix, the meaning is the same as a normal imperfect form with the conjunction.**  This in contrast to the Sequential Imperfect form, which utilizes a specialized form of the conjunction and contains a different meaning.  [See the article on Sequential Imperfect verbs for more information regarding how to identify the sequential perfect form and how it differs in meaning from the normal perfect verb.]

Sometimes the imperfect verb occurs within a clause after another finite verb.  In these cases, the context must determine whether the imperfect verb is complementing the main verb or whether the imperfect verb is communicating its own verbal idea.  There are other times, especially in poetry, when the reader finds an imperfect form in a place where a perfect form is expected.  The context must determine the correct translation in these cases.

The imperfect form can indicate any of the following kinds of actions:

#### 1) Future actions, events, or expectations

> Gen 2:17 –  וְלַחֹ֖שֶׁךְ קָ֣רָא לָ֑יְלָה  "...in the day you eat from it, surely ***you will die***..."
> 
> Gen 4:10 -  וַיֹּ֖אמֶר מֶ֣ה עָשִׂ֑יתָ  "And he said, 'What ***have you done***?'..."
> 
> Gen 31:32 –  וְלֹֽא־יָדַ֣ע יַעֲקֹ֔ב כִּ֥י רָחֵ֖ל גְּנָבָֽתַם׃  "...but Jacob did not know that Rachel ***had stolen*** them."

#### 2) Present actions or events

> Gen 24:33 –  לֹ֣א אֹכַ֔ל עַ֥ד אִם־דִּבַּ֖רְתִּי דְּבָרָ֑י  "...I will not eat until ***I have spoken*** my message."

#### 3) Habitual actions (can be past, present, or future time)

> Num 14:2 –  לוּ־מַ֙תְנוּ֙ בְּאֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרַ֔יִם  "...Would that ***we had died*** in the land of Egypt!..."
> 
> Judg 8:19 –  ל֚וּ הַחֲיִתֶ֣ם אוֹתָ֔ם לֹ֥א הָרַ֖גְתִּי אֶתְכֶֽם׃  "...If ***you had let*** them ***live***, I would not kill you ..."

#### 4) Commands (especially prohibitions)

> Gen 27:2 –  וַיֹּ֕אמֶר הִנֵּה־נָ֖א זָקַ֑נְתִּי  "And he said, 'Behold, ***I am old***...'"

#### 5) Potential actions or events

> Gen 1:29 –  וַיֹּ֣אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֗ים הִנֵּה֩ נָתַ֨תִּי לָכֶ֜ם אֶת־כָּל־עֵ֣שֶׂב׀ זֹרֵ֣עַ זֶ֗רַע  "And God said, 'Behold, ***I am giving*** to you every seed-producing plant...'"

#### 6) Desirable (or undesirable) actions or events

> Jer 8:7 –  וְתֹ֤ר וְסִוס֙ וְעָג֔וּר שָׁמְר֖וּ אֶת־עֵ֣ת בֹּאָ֑נָה  "...and the turtledove, the swallow, and the crane ***keep*** the time of their coming..."

#### 7) Past actions of duration (usually with a temporal marker טֶרֶם or עַד or אָז)

> Psa 22:22 –  ה֭וֹשִׁיעֵנִי מִפִּ֣י אַרְיֵ֑ה  "***Save me*** from the mouth of the lion! ..."
