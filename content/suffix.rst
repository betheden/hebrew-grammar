Suffix
======

Summary
-------

A suffix consists of one or more letters added to the end of a word.  Nouns, verbs, adjectives, prepositions, participles,
infinitives and even some particles can take suffixes in Biblical Hebrew.

-------

Biblical Hebrew utilizes four different types of suffixes.  The most common type is the
:ref:`pronominal suffix<suffix_pronominal>` which changes form based on both gender and number.  However, there are also three
other simple suffixes called the :ref:`directional ה (he)<suffix_directional_he>`, the :ref:`paragogic ה (he)<suffix_paragogic_he>`,
and the :ref:`paragogic נ (nun)<suffix_paragogic_nun>`.

.. note:: These suffixes should not be confused with the prefixes and suffixes that are added to :ref:`finite verbs<verb-finite>` to form verbal conjugations, although certain forms appear very similar.
