.. note:: כִּי is one of the most flexible words in Biblical Hebrew in terms
          of its meaning. It can function either as a conjunction or as a
          particle, with many different potential meanings. If in doubt, it is
          recommended to *always* consult a dictionary or lexicon to confirm how
          the word is being used in any specific instance.
