# suffix_pronominal Article
Pronominal Suffixes are one or two letters at the end of a noun, or after a preposition. They refer to a person or an object and can therefore be Masculine or Feminine, Singular or Plural, and be in 1st, 2nd, or 3rd person, depending on who or what they are referring to.

The suffixes look similar to the corresponding Personal Pronouns, and in many languages will have to be translated with a separate word. The person or object to which the suffix refers can indicate possession (as with nouns), or be a direct or indirect object (as with prepositions and verbs), depending on the context.

## Nouns
Nouns must be in the Construct form before a pronominal suffix can be added and having a pronominal suffix automatically makes the noun definite.
