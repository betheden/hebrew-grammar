Verb Sequential Imperfect
=========================

Summary
-------

A verb with sequential prefix conjugation functions generally like a
verb with *suffix conjugation*, but it also connects to an earlier verb
to form either a sequence of time or a sequence of thought.

Article
-------

The sequential prefix conjugation of a
:ref:`verb`
looks similar to the normal :ref:`verb_imperfect`,
but it is a separate verbal form and must be treated as such. A
Sequential Prefix Conjugation verb does not function like a normal
Prefix Conjugation verb, but it functions similar to a *:ref:`verb_perfect`*
verb. The difference is an added sense of being connected to an earlier
verb to form a sequence of time or a sequence of thought. In Hebrew
narratives, the Sequential Prefix Conjugation also serves the function
of controlling the flow of a story en often occurs at the beginning of a
sentence.

The endings of the Sequential Prefix Conjugation are teh same as the
normal Prefix Conjugation but the Sequential form also has an extra
prefix, which is a *specialized* form of the
:ref:`conjunction`.
The difference between the Sequential Prefix Conjugation and the normal
Prefix Conjugation with the conjunction is in the vowel pattern. The
normal Prefix Conjugation with the conjunction looks exactly like what
one would expect: a normal conjunction (וְ) is added to the beginning of
the normal Prefix Conjugation (יִקְטֹל) to make a single word
(וְיִקְטֹל). However, the Sequential Prefix Conjugation looks different
(וַיִּקְטֹל). In contrast to the normal Prefix Conjugation with the
conjunction, the Sequential Prefix Conjugation usually contains (1) a
vowel (usually pathach) under the conjunction instead of the shewa, and
(2) a daghesh in the prefix consonant of the verbal form (see table
below).
