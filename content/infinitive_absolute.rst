Infinitive Absolute
===================

Summary
-------

The infinitive absolute is an extremely flexible verbal form and can
function as an adverb, a verb, or a noun. Its most common use is to
express intensity or certainty of verbal action.

Article
-------

Of all the verbal conjugations in Biblical Hebrew, the infinitive
absolute is the simplest in form but the most complex in function,
demanding the most sensitivity to its context to determine its meaning.
The infinitive absolute is described as being in the :ref:`state_absolute`
because it always stands entirely on its own as an independent
grammatical entity. The form never occurs in any kind of construction
with a prefix or
:ref:`suffix`,
an attached preposition, or even another
:ref:`noun`
in a construct chain. The infinitive absolute generally has only one
form in each
:ref:`stem`
(Qal, Niphal, Piel, etc.), and it does not conjugate according to
person, gender, or number like the :ref:`verb-finite-verbs`
forms. Grammatically, the infinitive absolute can function as an
:ref:`adverb`,
a finite verb, or even as a noun. The context must be carefully
investigated to discern the precise meaning of an infinitive absolute in
each instance.

Function
--------

The infinitive absolute can express the following range of meanings.

Expresses intensity or certainty of verbal action
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In most cases, the infinitive absolute is paired with a finite verb of
the same root. When used in this way, the infinitive absolute functions
adverbially, either certifying or intensifying the action of the main
verb, depending on the context. Normally the infinitive absolute
precedes the main verb, except with
:ref:`verb_imperative`
and
:ref:`participle_active`;
in those cases, the infinitive absolute follows.

The following example shows the infinitive absolute expressing intensity of
action.

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 2:16

  מִכֹּ֥ל עֵֽץ־הַגָּ֖ן **אָכֹ֥ל** תֹּאכֵֽל
  mikkol 'ets-haggan **'akhol** tokhel
  from-every tree-of\_the-garden **eating** you-may-eat
  From every tree in the garden you may **freely** eat.

The following example shows the infinitive absolute expressing certainty of
action.

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 2:17

  בְּי֛וֹם אֲכָלְךָ֥ מִמֶּ֖נּוּ **מ֥וֹת** תָּמֽוּת
  beyom 'akholkha mimmennu **moth** tamuth
  in-day-of your-eating from-it **dying** you-will-die
  "on the day that you eat from it, you will **surely** die."

Functions as a :ref:`verb-finite-verbs`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The infinitive absolute often substitutes for a finite verb. In these
cases, the infinitive absolute can carry an emotive sense and should be
treated with great sensitivity to the context for precise nuance of
meaning. The examples listed below are not comprehensive, but only
provide a sampling of potential options for the exact meaning.

.. csv-table:: Example: JOB 40:2

  הֲ֭רֹב עִם־שַׁדַּ֣י יִסּ֑וֹר
  harov 'im-shadday **yissor**
  [quest.]-contend with\_Almighty **faultfinder**
  "Should anyone who wishes to criticize **try to correct** the
     Almighty?"

The following example shows the infinitive absolute continuing the action
of the preceding verb.

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 41:43

  וְנָת֣וֹן אֹת֔וֹ עַ֖ל כָּל־אֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרָֽיִם׃
  **wenathon** 'otho 'al kol-'erets mitsrayim
  **and-placing** [dir.obj]-him over whole\_land-of Egypt
  Pharaoh **put** him over all the land of Egypt.

The following example shows the infinitive absolute functioning as an
emphatic command (either direct or indirect).

.. csv-table:: Example: EXO 20:8

  זָכ֛וֹר אֶת־י֥וֹם הַשַּׁבָּ֖ת
  **zakhor** 'eth-yom hashabbath
  **Remember** [dir.obj]\_day the-Sabbath
  **Remember** the Sabbath day

The following example shows the infinitive absolute functioning ambiguously
(could be :ref:`adverb` or finite verbs).

.. csv-table:: Example: HOS 10:4

  דִּבְּר֣וּ דְבָרִ֔ים **אָל֥וֹת** שָׁ֖וְא **כָּרֹ֣ת** בְּרִ֑ית
  dibberu devarim **'aloth** shawe **karoth** berith
  they-speak words **swearing** emptiness **cutting** covenant
  "They speak empty words and **make** covenants by **swearing**
     falsely."

Complements the action of the main verb
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An infinitive absolute (or a pair of infinitive absolutes) can follow a
finite verb of a different root to describe complementary action.

In the following example, a single infinitive absolute is functioning
adverbially.

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 30:32

  "אֶֽעֱבֹ֨ר בְּכָל־צֹֽאנְךָ֜ הַיּ֗וֹם **הָסֵ֨ר** מִשָּׁ֜ם כָּל־שֶׂ֣ה׀
     נָקֹ֣ד וְטָל֗וּא"
  'e'evor bekhol-tsonekha hayyom **haser** misham kol-seh naqod wetalu
  "let-me-pass though-all\_your-flock today **turning aside** from-there
     every\_sheep speckled and-spotted"
  "Let me walk through all your flock today, **removing** from it every
     speckled and spotted sheep"

In the following example, a pair of infinitive absolutes are functioning
adverbially.

.. csv-table:: Example: 1SA 3:12

  בַּיּ֤וֹם הַהוּא֙ אָקִ֣ים ... הָחֵ֖ל וְכַלֵּֽה
  bayyom hahu' 'aqim ... **hahel wekhalleh**
  in-the-day the-that I-will-carry-out ... **beginning and-ending**.
  On that day I will carry out ... **from beginning to end**.

Expresses progression or continuance of verbal action (הלךְ)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The infinitive absolute (and sometimes the
:ref:`participle_active`)
of the specific root הלךְ can be used to express a sense of progression
or continuance of the action of a main verb.

.. csv-table:: Example: Gen 8:3

  וַיָּשֻׁ֧בוּ הַמַּ֛יִם מֵעַ֥ל הָאָ֖רֶץ הָל֣וֹךְ וָשׁ֑וֹב
  wayyashuvu hammayim me'al ha'arets **halokh washov**
  "and-they-returned the-waters from-over the-earth **going
     and-returning**"
  The flood waters receded from off the earth **continually**.

.. csv-table:: Example: 2SA 18:25

  וַיֵּ֥לֶךְ הָל֖וֹךְ וְקָרֵֽב
  wayyelekh **halokh weqarev**
  and-he-walked **going and-approaching**
  The runner came **closer and neared** the city.

.. csv-table:: Example: JDG 14:9

  וַיֵּ֤לֶךְ הָלוֹךְ֙ וְאָכֹ֔ל
  wayyelekh **halokh we'akhol**
  And-he-walked **going and-eating**
  "He ... went on, **eating as he went**"

Functions as a Verbal :ref:`noun`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is an extremely rare use of the infinitive absolute.

.. csv-table:: Example: ISA 22:13

  "וְהִנֵּ֣ה׀ שָׂשׂ֣וֹן וְשִׂמְחָ֗ה **הָרֹ֤ג**\ ׀ בָּקָר֙ **וְשָׁחֹ֣ט**
  צֹ֔אן **אָכֹ֥ל** בָּשָׂ֖ר **וְשָׁת֣וֹת** יָ֑יִן"
  "wehinneh sason wesimhah **harog** baqar **weshahot** tson **'akhol**
  basar **weshathoth** yayin"
  "and-behold joy and-gladness **killing** flesh **and-slaughtering** sheep
  **eating** flesh **and-drinking** wine"
  "But look, instead, celebration and gladness, **killing** cattle **and
  slaughtering** sheep, **eating** meat **and drinking** wine"
