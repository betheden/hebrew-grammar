Stem Polpal
===========

Summary

The Polpal is a rare stem formation that is similar to the Pual. It
expresses the passive voice of the Pilpel stem.

Article
-------

The Polpal stem is a variation of the :ref:`stem_pual`
and expresses the passive voice of the verbal action of the :ref:`stem_pilpel`.
The Polpal stem is formed from the Pual by dropping the 2nd radical and
repeating the 1st and 3rd radicals (with a vowel change), thus making a
verb that appears to have 4 consonants. It is an extremely rare verbal
form in Biblical Hebrew.
