# verb Article
A verb is a word in a sentence that describes an action by the subject of a sentence, or the subject itself. The verb is therefore often the most important word in understanding a sentence or a clause.

## Form
In Hebrew, the root of a verb consists of three consonants, this is sometimes called the "Triliteral Root". In "strong" verbs, those three root consonants always stay the same and are easy to recognize, but "weak" verbs have one or more consonants that, in some forms, disappear.

The conjugation of a verb usually happens by adding prefixes and suffixes that show which stem (Qal, Niphal, Hiphil, etc.), tense (Perfect, Imperfect, Infinitive, etc.), person (First, Second, or Third), gender (Masculine or Feminine), number (Singular or Plural), and state (Construct or Absolute) the verb has. The person, gender, and number of a verb always agree with the subject.

Unlike English, but similar to other languages like Spanish, it is not necessary to have a separate personal pronoun if the subject is not identified since the form of the verb includes the subject. And a pronominal suffix can function as an object.

## Types of verbs
Grammarians often distinguish between different types of verbs. It is helpful to understand what kind of verb you are dealing with when looking for the best way to translate a sentence.

### Action or Dynamic verbs
Action verbs are used to describe a subject doing something.

* 2KI 1:5
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>וַיָּשׁ֥וּבוּ הַמַּלְאָכִ֖ים אֵלָ֑יו</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>wayyashuvu hammal'akhim 'elayw **[Trial Transliteration]**</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>And they returned, the messangers, to him</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>When the messengers returned to him</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

* JON 1:4
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>וַֽיהוָ֗ה הֵטִ֤יל רֽוּחַ־גְּדֹולָה֙ אֶל־הַיָּ֔ם</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>wayhwah hetil ruah-gedowlah 'el-hayyam **[Trial Transliteration]**</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>And Yahweh cast a great wind on the sea</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>But Yahweh sent out a great wind on the sea</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

#### Transitive verbs
A transitive verb is an action verb where there must be an object that receives or undergoes the action. Without the object the sentence would not be complete.

* RUT 1:14
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>וַתִּשֶּׂ֣נָה קֹולָ֔ן</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>wattissenah qowlan **[Trial Transliteration]**</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>And they lifted up their voice</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Then they lifted up their voices</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
(Without object: "And they lifted up", they lifted up what?)

* PRO 7:1
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>שְׁמֹ֣ר אֲמָרָ֑י</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>shemor 'amaray **[Trial Transliteration]**</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>keep my words</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>keep my words</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

(Without object: "[you must] keep", you must keep what?)

#### Intransitive verbs
An intransitive verb does not have an object receiving the action.

* EXO 11:1
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>וַיֹּ֨אמֶר יְהוָ֜ה אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֗ה</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>wayyomer yehwah 'el-mosheh **[Trial Transliteration]**</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>And Yahweh said to Moses</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Then Yahweh said to Moses</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

* DAN 9:4
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>וָֽאֶתְפַּֽלְלָ֛ה לַיהוָ֥ה אֱלֹהַ֖י</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>wa'ethpalelah layhwah 'elohay **[Trial Transliteration]**</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>And I prayed to Yahweh my God</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>I prayed to Yahweh my God</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Non Action or Stative verbs
Unlike action verbs, non action or stative verbs describe the way a subject is.

* GEN 48:10 (verb: "to be heavy")
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>וְעֵינֵ֤י יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ כָּבְד֣וּ מִזֹּ֔קֶן</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>we'ene yisra'el kovdu mizzoqen **[Trial Transliteration]**</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>And the eyes of Israel were heavy from age</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Now Israel's eyes were failing because of his age</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

* NUM 13:33
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>וַנְּהִ֤י בְעֵינֵ֨ינוּ֙ כַּֽחֲגָבִ֔ים</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>wannehi ve'enenu kahagavim **[Trial Transliteration]**</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>And we were, in our eyes, like grashoppers</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>In our own sight we were like grasshoppers</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
	
### Linking verbs
Linking verbs are verbs that link two nouns, or a noun and an adjective. Hebrew has few linking verbs, so often a linking verb has to be supplied in English.

* RUT 2:6
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>נַעֲרָ֤ה מֹֽואֲבִיָּה֙ הִ֔יא</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>na'arah mow'aviyyah hi **[Trial Transliteration]**</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>Young woman Moabite she</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>She is the young Moabite woman</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
(linking verb: "is", not present in the Hebrew)

* 1SA 11:10
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>כְּכָל־הַטֹּ֖וב בְּעֵינֵיכֶֽם׃</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>kekhol-hattowv be'enekhem **[Trial Transliteration]**</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>like all the good in your eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>whatever seems good to you.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
(linking verb: "seems", not present in the Hebrew)

### Auxiliary and Modal verbs
Hebrew does not have auxiliary and modal verbs, but English does. It is often necessary to supply an auxiliary or modal verb in English to express what the Hebrew says.

#### Auxiliary verbs in translation
English uses auxiliary verbs in questions and negations, even if the Hebrew does not.

* 1SA 13:11
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>מֶ֣ה עָשִׂ֑יתָ</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>meh 'asitha **[Trial Transliteration]**</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>What you did?</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>What have you done?</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
(verb: "done", auxiliary verb in English: "have")

* EZR 5:5
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>וְלָא־בַטִּ֣לוּ הִמֹּ֔ו</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>wela-vattilu himmow **[Trial Transliteration]**</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>and not they stopped them</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>and they did not stop them</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
(verb: "stop", auxiliary verb in English: "did")

#### Modal verbs in translation
English uses modal verbs to express modality. In Hebrew this modality is already present in the form of the verb or implied by the context.

* LEV 14:22
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>אֲשֶׁ֥ר תַּשִּׂ֖יג יָדֹ֑ו</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>'asher tassig yadow **[Trial Transliteration]**</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>which he can reach</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>such as he is able to get</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
(verb: "reach/get", modal verb: "can/is able to")

* JOB 38:34
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>וְֽשִׁפְעַת־מַ֥יִם תְּכַסֶּֽךָּ׃</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>weshif'ath-mayim tekhassekka **[Trial Transliteration]**</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>and a large amount of water may cover you</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>so that an abundance of rainwater may cover you</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

(verb: "cover", modal verb: "may")
