# preposition Glossary
A preposition is a word that describes the relationship of a noun (or word that functions as a noun) to another word/concept in the sentence.  In Biblical Hebrew, prepositions are also used with infinitive construct verbs to show the relationship between a verbal complement and the main verb of a sentence.
