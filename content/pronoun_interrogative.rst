Pronoun Interrogative
=====================

Summary
-------

An interrogative pronoun is a pronoun that appears at the beginning of a clause/sentence and indicates that the clause/sentence
is an interrogative question rather than an indicative statement.

In Biblical Hebrew, a family of :ref:`interrogative particles<particle_interrogative>` function as interrogative pronouns,
and many scholars use the terms "interrogative pronouns" and "interrogative particles" interchangeably. The two most common
interrogative particles are מִי (personal interrogative pronoun, referring to a person) and מָה (impersonal interrogative pronoun,
referring to a thing).  These two pronouns can also function as :ref:`indefinite pronouns<pronoun_indefinite>`, especially when
they appear in the middle of a clause/sentence rather than at the beginning. As a general rule, the particles מִי or מָה function
as interrogative pronouns when they appear at the beginning of a clause/sentence, and function as indefinite pronouns when they
appear in the middle of a sentence or clause. However, this is not a universal rule; the specific use of these pronouns must
always be determined from the context.
