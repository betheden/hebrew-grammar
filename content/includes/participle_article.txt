Participles in Biblical Hebrew are verbal :ref:`noun`\s.
Like the infinitive forms, they conjugate in the various :ref:`stem`
formations. They also inflect for person and gender like both 
:ref:`adjective`\s and :ref:`noun`\s. They can also appear in either the
:ref:`state_absolute` or the :ref:`state_construct`, like nouns.
Participles are very flexible in their grammatical use and can function
as a verbal complement, a :ref:`verb-finite-verbs`, an :ref:`adjective`,
or a :ref:`noun`.  In most cases, the context will clearly show how the 
participle is being used in the sentence. The meaning of a participle is 
usually clear, even in cases where its specific grammatical function cannot 
be determined precisely.
