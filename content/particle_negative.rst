Particle Negative
=================

Summary
-------

Negative particles are terms that negate a word or some aspect of a
sentence.

אַיִן or אֵין
-------------

This term is used in verbless clauses to negate an entire clause or
sentence. It is sometimes classified as a :ref:`noun_common`
but usually appears in the :ref:`word_order`.
Literally, the term is translated in English as "there is no" or "there
is not"; but the English translation is often simplified to "is not"
(see example below).

-  ISA 45:5

  אֲנִ֤י יְהוָה֙ **וְאֵ֣ין** עֹ֔וד זוּלָתִ֖י **אֵ֣ין** אֱלֹהִ֑ים
  'ani yehwah **we'en** 'owd zulathi **'en** 'elohim
  "I Yahweh **and-there-is-no** beside apart-from-me **there-is-no**
     God."
  "I am Yahweh, **and there is no** other; **there is no** God but me."

-  2KI 1:3

  **For-nothing is-there-no**\ \_God in-Israel?
  Is it because **there is no** God in Israel?

-  GEN 37:29

  wehinneh **'en**-yosef babbor
  and-behold **there-is-no**\ \_Joseph in-the-pit
  "and, behold, Joseph **was not** in the pit"

.. _particle_negative-lo:

לֹא
---

The word לֹא is the standard negative particle in Biblical Hebrew. This
term often negates verbs, but it has potential to negate other kinds of
words as well. In English, it is usually translated as "no" or "not".
When used with :ref:`person_second`
:ref:`verb_imperfect-direct-negative-commands`
verbs to express a negative command, this particle signifies a more
emphatic command than the use of the negative particle אַל.

-  GEN 2:17

.. csv-table::

  לֹ֥א תֹאכַ֖ל מִמֶּ֑נּוּ
  **lo** thokhal mimmennu
  **not** you-eat from-it
  you may **not** eat from it

.. _particle_negative-al:

אַל
---

The term אַַל is almost exclusively used to negate verbs; it is also the
standard particle used to negate jussive and cohortative verbs. When
used with :ref:`person_second`
:ref:`verb_imperfect`
verbs to express a negative command, this particle signifies a less
emphatic command than the use of the negative particle לֹא.

-  GEN 21:16

.. csv-table::

  אַל־אֶרְאֶ֖ה בְּמ֣וֹת הַיָּ֑לֶד
  **'al**-'er'eh bemoth hayyaled
  **Not**\ \_I-will-look in-death-of the-child.
  Let me **not** look upon the death of the child.

בִּלְתִּי
---------

This term is used (especially with לְ) to negate :ref:`infinitive_construct`
verbs, and is usually translated in English as "no" or "not".

.. note:: This term is most often used as a concessive conjunction;
          a dictionary or lexicon will indicate the specific use of
          this particle in each individual context.

-  GEN 3:11

.. csv-table::

  צִוִּיתִ֛יךָ \ **לְבִלְתִּ֥י** אֲכָל־מִמֶּ֖נּוּ
  tsiwwithikha **leviltiy** 'akhol-mimmennu
  I-commanded-you **to-not** eat\_from-it
  I commanded you **to not** eat from it

בַּל or בְּלִי (sometimes בְּלֹא)
---------------------------------

These particles are usually used in poetry and carry no special meaning
other than to negate a word or concept within a sentence. In English,
they are usually translated as "no" or "not".
