# verb_sequential_imperfect Article
The sequential imperfect form looks similar to a normal imperfect verb, but it is a completely separate verbal form and must be treated as such. A sequential imperfect verb does not function like an imperfect verb.  Rather, it acts like a *perfect* verb, but with the added sense of being connected to an earlier verb to form a sequence of time or a sequence of thought.  In Hebrew narratives, the sequential imperfect verb also serves the function of controlling the flow of a story.

The sequential imperfect form takes the same verbal endings as the imperfect form but includes a *specialized* form of the conjunction as a prefix.  There is a difference between the sequential imperfect form and a normal imperfect form with the conjunction.  A normal imperfect form with the conjunction looks exactly like what one would expect: a normal conjunction (וְ) is added to the beginning of a normal imperfect form (יִקְטֹל) to make a single word (וְיִקְטֹל).  However, the sequential imperfect form looks significantly different (וַיִּקְטֹל).  In contrast to the normal imperfect with the conjunction, the sequential imperfect form usually contains (1) a vowel (usually pathach) under the conjunction instead of the shewa, and (2) a daghesh in the prefix consonant of the verbal form (see examples below).

* Hebrew verb כָּתַב: normal imperfect + conjunction = וְיִכְתֹּב; sequential imperfect = וַיִּכְתֹּב.

* Hebrew verb פָּעַל: normal imperfect + conjunction = וְיִפְעַל; sequential imperfect = וַיִּפְעַל.

* Hebrew verb קָרָא: normal imperfect + conjunction = וְיִקְרָא; sequential imperfect = וַיִּקְרָא.


The sequential imperfect form indicates any one of these kinds of verbal actions:
