Stem Hiphil
===========

Summary
-------

The Hiphil stem generally expresses causative action in active voice,
but it can also express other kinds of verbal action depending on the
context and the specific verb.

Article
-------

The Hiphil form is a verbal :ref:`stem formation<stem>` in Biblical Hebrew, usually indicated by a הִ prefix before
the 1st radical and a hireq-yod (or sometimes tsere) vowel under the 2nd
radical of the
:ref:`verb<verb>`.
(This ה changes in the
:ref:`participle<participle_active>` and :ref:`Imperfect<verb_imperfect>`
forms.) The Hiphil stem is generally used to express causative action in
active voice. In many cases the
:ref:`noun<noun>`
derived from the same root is the object or result of the hiphil verb
associated with that root. For example, the Hiphil verb הִמְטִיר means
"to cause to rain down"; the noun מָטָר means "rain".

Function
--------

The Hiphil stem can express any of the following kinds of verbal action:

Expresses causative action
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Causative action means that the subject of the verb is causing the
object of the verb either to perform the verbal action (for :ref:`dynamic<verb-dynamic>` verb)
or to be in the state described by the verb (for :ref:`stative<verb-stative>` verbs).
The Hiphil stem usually serves this causative function with dynamic
verbs (and sometimes with stative verbs also). A good example is the
verb בּוֹא. In the :ref:`Qal<stem_qal>` stem, the verb בּוֹא expresses the simple action
"to come" or "to go". But in the Hiphil stem, the verb בּוֹא expresses
the causative action "to bring" (meaning, *to cause something to
come/go*). In English, causative action is expressed using the main verb
"to cause" paired with the infinitive of the verbal action in view. In
Biblical Hebrew, the causative nature of the verbal action is expressed
by the Hiphil form of the verb itself with no additional verbal element.

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 4:3

  וַיָּבֵ֨א קַ֜יִן מִפְּרִ֧י הָֽאֲדָמָ֛ה מִנְחָ֖ה לַֽיהוָֽה
  **wayyave** qayin mipperi ha'adamah minhah layhwah
  **And-he-brought** Cain from-fruit-of the-ground offering to-Yahweh
  "Cain **brought** some of the fruit of the ground as an offering to
     Yahweh."

.. csv-table:: Example: 1KI 1:43

  אֲבָ֕ל אֲדֹנֵ֥ינוּ הַמֶּֽלֶךְ־דָּוִ֖ד **הִמְלִ֥יךְ** אֶת־שְׁלֹמֹֽה
  'aval 'adonenu hammelekh-dawid **himlikh** 'eth-shelomoh
  But our-lord the-king\_David **he-made-king** [dir.obj]\_Solomon
  But king David our lord **crowned** Solomon **king**

Expresses various kinds of simple or causative action
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Biblical Hebrew, some verbs are found only in the Hiphil stem (and/or
its derivative stem formations). In these cases, the Hiphil usually
expresses a simple action which is causative by its very nature. A good
example is the Hebrew verb סוּת, which occurs only in the Hiphil stem
and means "to incite" or "to entice". A dictionary or lexicon will
indicate all the stem formations in which a particular verb is found as
well as the appropriate meaning(s).

.. csv-table:: Example: JER 43:3

  כִּ֗י בָּרוּךְ֙ בֶּן־נֵ֣רִיָּ֔ה **מַסִּ֥ית** אֹתְךָ֖ בָּ֑נוּ
  ki barukh ben-neriyyah **massith** 'othekha banu
  for Baruch son-of\_Neriah **is-inciting** [dir.obj]-you in-us
  For Baruch son of Neriah **is inciting** you against us

Some verbs express *different* meanings in *different* stem formations.
A good example is the verb גָּלָה. In the :ref:`Qal<stem_qal>` stem,
the verb גָּלָה expresses the simple action "to uncover" or "to reveal".
But in the Hiphil stem, the verb גָּלָה expresses the simple action "to
exile". Again, this will be indicated by a dictionary or lexicon.

.. csv-table:: Example: AMO 5:27

  וְהִגְלֵיתִ֥י אֶתְכֶ֖ם מֵהָ֣לְאָה לְדַמָּ֑שֶׂק
  **wehiglethi** 'ethkhem mehal'ah ledammaseq
  **And-I-will-exile** [dir.obj]-you from-beyond to-Damascus
  Therefore **I will exile you** beyond Damascus

Some verbs express the *same* meaning in *multiple* stem formations. A
good example is the verb יָדַע, which expresses the causative action "to
make known" (meaning, *to cause to know*) in both the :ref:`Piel<stem_piel>` stem
and the Hiphil stem. This also will be indicated by a dictionary or
lexicon.

.. csv-table:: Example: PSA 98:2

  הוֹדִ֣יעַ יְ֭הוָה יְשׁוּעָת֑וֹ
  **hodia'** yehwah yeshu'atho
  **He-made-known** Yahweh his-salvation
  Yahweh **has made known** his salvation

The Hiphil stem can also be used to express miscellaneous kinds of
simple or causative action that might not follow any of the other
descriptions listed above. As always, the specific meaning of the verb
will be indicated by a dictionary or lexicon.

Hiphil stem expressing idiomatic action:

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 6:12

  "וַיַּ֧רְא אֱלֹהִ֛ים אֶת־הָאָרֶץ וְהִנֵּ֣ה נִשְׁחָ֑תָה
     כִּֽי־\ **הִשְׁחִ֧ית** כָּל־בָּשָׂ֛ר אֶת־דַּרְכּ֖וֹ עַל־הָאָרֶץ"
  "wayyar 'elohim 'eth-ha'arets wehinneh nishhathah ki-\ **hishhith**
     kol-basar 'eth-darko 'al-ha'arets"
  "And-he-saw God [dir.obj]\_the-land and-behold it-was-corrupt
     because\_\ **made-corrupt** all\_flesh [dir.obj]\_his-way
     on\_the-land."
  "And God saw the land and behold it was corrupt because all flesh
     **had corrupted** its ways upon the land."

Hiphil stem declaring a state rather than expressing an action:

.. csv-table:: Example: 1KI 8:32

  "לְהַרְשִׁ֣יעַ רָשָׁ֔ע לָתֵ֥ת דַּרְכּ֖וֹ בְּרֹאשׁ֑וֹ
     **וּלְהַצְדִּ֣יק** צַדִּ֔יק לָ֥תֶת ל֖וֹ כְּצִדְקָתֽוֹ׃"
  "**leharshia'** rasha' latheth darko berosho **ulehatsdiq** tsaddiq
     latheth lo ketsidqatho"
  "**to-condemn** evil-person to-give his-way on-his-head
     **and-to-declare-righteous** righteous-person to-give to-him
     according-to-his-righteousness"
  "**To condemn** the evildoer, to punish him according to his actions,
     **and to vindicate** the righteous man, to reward him according to
     his righteousness."
