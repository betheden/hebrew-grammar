Stem

Summary
-------

The stem formation of a verb indicates both the kind of verbal action
(simple, stative, causative, etc.) and the voice (active, passive,
reflexive, etc.) of the verb.

Article
-------

In Biblical Hebrew, all :ref:`verbs<verb>` have both a stem formation (Qal, Niphal, Piel, etc.) and a conjugation
(Perfect, Imperfect, Imperative, etc.). These work together like two "layers", and each layer supplies different
information about the verb. In Biblical Hebrew, there are seven major stem formations and several rare ones.

Form
----

This is a brief overview on how to quickly recognize the simplest forms
of each stem:

:ref:`Qal<stem_qal>` stem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The simplest form of the verb, usually with "a" vowels (qamets or patah).

:ref:`Niphal<stem_niphal>` stem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Adds נִ (nun with hireq) to the beginning of the verb. If the form also
adds a prefix (like in the prefix conjugation), the נ disappears and
causes the 1st radical to double (with a daghesh).

:ref:`Hiphil<stem_hiphil>` stem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Often has הִ (he with hireq) before the verb, or a patah under the
letter that the form adds before the root.

:ref:`Hophal<stem_hophal>` stem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Also adds a ה before the verb, but with a qamets hatuf (or sometimes
qibbuts) vowel.


:ref:`Piel<stem_piel>` stem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here the 2nd radical of the verb is doubled (with a daghesh), and
usually have a shewa or a hireq under the 1st radical.

:ref:`Pual<stem_pual>` stem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Also doubles the 2nd radical but often has a qibbuts under the 1st
radical.

:ref:`Hithpael<stem_hithpael>` stem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It adds הִתְ (he with hireq and taw with shewa) before the verb, and
puts a qamets or patah under the 1st radical.

Function

The following table is a brief overview of the most common stems and
their most common functions.

Expresses the kind of verbal action
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Simple action
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Simple action refers to a typical :ref:`dynamic<verb-dynamic>` verb;
that is, the verb describes an action being performed by the subject of the verb.

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 16:2 –– Qal stem expressing simple action (dynamic verb)

  וַתֹּ֨אמֶר שָׂרַ֜י אֶל־אַבְרָ֗ם
  **wattomer** saray 'el-'avram
  **And-she-said** Sarai to\_Abram
  So Sarai **said** to Abram

Stative action
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Stative action refers to a typical :ref:`stative<verb-stative>` verb;
that is, the verb describes the subject of the verb as being in a certain state/condition.

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 6:11 –– Qal stem expressing stative action (stative verb)

  וַתִּמָּלֵ֥א הָאָ֖רֶץ חָמָֽס
  **wattimmale** ha'arets hamas
  **and-it-was-full** the-earth violence
  **and it was filled** with violence.

Causative action
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Causative action means that the subject of the verb is causing the
object of the verb either to perform the verbal action (with :ref:`dynamic<verb-dynamic>` verbs)
or to be in the state described by the verb (with :ref:`stative<verb-stative>` verbs).
In English, causative action is expressed using the main verb "to cause" paired with the infinitive of the verbal action
in view. In Biblical Hebrew, the causative nature of the verbal action
is expressed by the stem formation itself with no additional
verbal element.

.. csv-table:: Example: PSA 98:2 –– Hiphil stem expressing causative action of a dynamic verb ("to cause to know")

  הוֹדִ֣יעַ יְ֭הוָה יְשׁוּעָת֑וֹ
  **hodia'** yehwah yeshu'atho
  **He-made-known** Yahweh his-salvation
  Yahweh **has made known** his salvation

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 21:19 –– Piel stem expressing causative action of a stative verb ("to cause to be filled")

  וַתֵּ֜לֶךְ **וַתְּמַלֵּ֤א** אֶת־הַחֵ֙מֶת֙ מַ֔יִם
  wattelekh **wattemalle** 'eth-hahemeth mayim
  and-she-went **and-she-filled** [dir.obj]\_the-skin-of water
  She went **and filled** the skin with water

Resultative action
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Resultative action means that the primary focus of the verb is on the
result of the verbal action.

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 21:6 –– Piel stem expressing resultative action

  וַיִּתֵּ֣ן ... וְאֶת־הַיֶּ֖לֶד וַֽיְשַׁלְּחֶ֑הָ
  wayyitten ... we'eth-hayyeled **wayeshalleheha**
  and-he-gave ... and-[dir.obj]\_the-boy **and-he-sent-her-away**
  He gave her the boy and **sent her away**


Intensive action
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Intensive action means that the verbal action is strengthened in some
way.

.. csv-table:: Example: EXO 9:25 –– Piel stem expressing intensive action

  אֶת־מִזְבְּחֹתָם֙ תִּתֹּצ֔וּן וְאֶת־מַצֵּבֹתָ֖ם תְּשַׁבֵּר֑וּן
  'eth-mizbehotham tittotsun we'eth-matsevotham **teshabberun**
  "[dir.obj]\_their-altars you-break-down and-[dir.obj]\_their-pillars
     **you-shatter**"
  "you must break down their altars, **smash** their stone pillars"

Expresses the voice of the verb
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Active voice
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Active voice means that the subject of the verb is performing the verbal action. Most verbs are in the active voice.

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 16:2

  וַתֹּ֨אמֶר שָׂרַ֜י אֶל־אַבְרָ֗ם
  **wattomer** saray 'el-'avram
  **And-she-said** Sarai to\_Abram
  So Sarai **said** to Abram

Passive voice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Passive voice means that the subject of the verb is *receiving* the
verbal action rather than *performing* the verbal action. In English, passive voice is
expressed using the helping verb "to be." In Biblical Hebrew, the
passive nature of the verbal action is expressed by the stem formation itself without any helping verbs.

.. csv-table:: Example: 2KI 21:18

  וַיִּקָּבֵ֥ר בְּגַן־בֵּית֖וֹ
  **wayyiqqaver** began-betho
  **and-he-was-buried** in-garden-of\_his-house
  **and he was buried** in the garden of his own house

Reflexive voice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reflexive voice means that the subject of the verb is *both* performing
*and* receiving the verbal action. In English, reflexive voice is expressed
using a reflexive pronoun as the object of the verb, "I tell *myself*".
In Biblical Hebrew, the reflexive nature of the verbal action is
expressed by the stem formation of the verb itself without any additional
words.

.. csv-table:: Example: NUM 1:21

  הִבָּ֣דְל֔וּ מִתּ֖וֹךְ הָעֵדָ֣ה הַזֹּ֑את
  **hibbodlu** mittokh ha'edah hazzoth
  **Separate-yourselves** from-midst-of the-congregation the-this
  **Separate yourselves** from among this community

Middle voice
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Middle voice means that the subject receives the verbal action but also is
(partially) involved in performing the verbal action. Middle voice
stands somewhere between passive voice and reflexive voice.

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 3:5

  וְנִפְקְח֖וּ עֵֽינֵיכֶ֑ם
  **wenifqehu** 'enekhem
  **and-they-will-be-opened** your-eyes
  your eyes **will be opened**

Reciprocal voice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reciprocal voice means that multiple subjects are in view who are both
performing the verbal action for another and receiving the verbal action from another.
In English, reciprocal voice is expressed using the phrase "each other"
as the object of the verb, "They tell each other." Reciprocal voice must be distinguished from reflexive voice. The phrase
"They tell themselves" is reflexive: the subject "they" is a unified
group and the action could be expressed reflexively for each individual
as "he tells himself, and he tells himself, and she tells herself, etc."
The phrase "They tell each other" is reciprocal: each member of the
group is telling something to another member of the group, and each
member of the group is being told something by another member of the
group.

Rare stem formations
--------------------

Most of these stems occur only a few times in the Hebrew Bible. Their
function is usually similar to one of the above stems, or a combination
of two of them. One simple rule that can help with a first guess as to
its function is this: If it sounds similar to one of the seven common
stems, it probably means something similar as well.

The uncommon stems are:
