Hebrew distinguishes between
:ref:`gender_masculine`
and
:ref:`gender_feminine`
in both
:ref:`number_singular`
and
:ref:`number_plural`.
It does not have a neutral "it," but since all nouns have a msculine or
feminine gender, it does not need a neutral form.

The third person can be found in
:ref:`verb`
forms, :ref:`pronoun_personal`,
and :ref:`suffix_pronominal`.
