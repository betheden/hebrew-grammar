=====================

Summary

An interrogative pronoun is a pronoun that introduces a question.

In Biblical Hebrew, a family of interrogative particles function as interrogative pronouns, and some scholars call them "interrogative pronouns" instead of "interrogative particles."  
Two of the most common ones (מִי and מָה) can also function as an 
:ref:`pronoun_indefinite`,
in which case the context has to make clear which one it is.  As a general rule, the particles מִי or מָה function as interrogative pronouns when they appear at the beginning of a sentence or clause, and function as indefinite pronouns when they appear in the middle of a sentence or clause.  However, this is not a universal rule.
