# word_order Article

The normal sentence structure in Biblical Hebrew is: (1) the [verb](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/verb/02.md), in first position; (2) the subject, in second position; (3) the object, in third position. Other grammatical elements such as [adjectives](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/adjective/02.md), [adverbs](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/adverb/02.md), prepositional phrases, discourse [particles](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/particle/02.md), etc. can be inserted at various points within that general sentence structure according to the conventions of the language. In the vast majority of cases, variations in word order do not affect the meaning of individual sentences much. However, in certain instances a grammatical element (most especially the subject) placed before the verb has implications for the general structure and/or chunking of a narrative. In these cases, the context must determine whether or not this indicates a new narrative or section of text, or whether or not this indicates a break in the narrative.

NOTE: As a general rule, these specific guidelines should not be applied to Hebrew poetry.

#### Introducing a new narrative or section of text (possibly)

Sometimes a grammatical element (usually the subject) is placed before the verb in order to initiate a new narrative, or a new section of text. Not all narratives begin this way in Biblical Hebrew; narratives often begin with a sequential prefix conjugation verb (see 1 Sam 1:1).

* JOB 1:1 – indicating a new narrative
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd" align="right"><td><b>אִ֛ישׁ</b> הָיָ֥ה בְאֶֽרֶץ־ע֖וּץ אִיּ֣וֹב שְׁמ֑וֹ</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>**'ish** hayah ve'erets-'uts 'iyyov shemo</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>**a man** there was in the land of Uz, Job his name</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>There was **a man** in the land of Uz whose name was Job</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

* 2KI 3:4 – indicating a new section of text
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd" align="right"><td>וּמֵישַׁ֥ע **מֶֽלֶךְ־מוֹאָ֖ב** הָיָ֣ה נֹקֵ֑ד</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>umesha' **melekh-mo'av** hayah noqed</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>and **Mesha king of Moab** was a sheep-breeder</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Now **Mesha king of Moab** bred sheep.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

A subject placed before the verb can also indicate a new section of a narrative, or a continuation after there has been a break in the narrative.

* 2SA 19:11 – indicating a new section of a narrative
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd" align="right"><td><b>וְהַמֶּ֣לֶךְ דָּוִ֗ד</b> שָׁ֠לַח אֶל־צָד֨וֹק וְאֶל־אֶבְיָתָ֥ר הַכֹּהֲנִים֮ לֵאמֹר֒</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>**wehammelekh dawid** shalah 'el-tsadoq we'el-'evyathar hakkohanim lemor</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>**and the king David** sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests saying</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>**King David** sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests saying</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

* 2SA 18:19 – indicating a continuation after a break in the narrative
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd" align="right"><td><b>וַאֲחִימַ֤עַץ</b> בֶּן־צָדוֹק֙ אָמַ֔ר</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>**wa'ahima'ats** ben-tsadoq 'amar</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>**and Ahimaaz** son of Zadok he said</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>**Then Ahimaaz** son of Zadok said</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

#### Indicating a break in the narrative (possibly)

It is most often the case that a grammatical element that has been placed in front of the verb does NOT indicate a break in the narrative.  Rather, it has been placed there for other reasons that do not apply to narrative structuring.

* GEN 1:5
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd" align="right"><td>וַיִּקְרָ֨א אֱלֹהִ֤ים׀ לָאוֹר֙ י֔וֹם **וְלַחֹ֖שֶׁךְ** קָ֣רָא לָ֑יְלָה</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>wayyiqra 'elohim la'or yom **welahoshekh** qara laylah</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>and he called out God to the light Day; **and to the darkness** he called out Night</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>God called the light "day," **and the darkness** he called "night."</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

* 2KI 3:22
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd" align="right"><td>וַיַּשְׁכִּ֣ימוּ בַבֹּ֔קֶר **וְהַשֶּׁ֖מֶשׁ** זָרְחָ֣ה עַל־הַמָּ֑יִם</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>wayyashkimu vabboqer **wehashemesh** zorhah 'al-hammayim</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>and they rose early in the morning **and the sun** had risen over the water</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>They awakened early in the morning **and the sun** reflected on the water.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

However, sometimes a grammatical element (usually the subject) placed before the verb can indicate a break in the narrative action in order to provide the reader with some extra information about the story being told. Usually, these instances will be clearly discerned from the context.

* 2KI 3:21
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd" align="right"><td><b>וְכָל־מוֹאָב֙</b> שָֽׁמְע֔וּ כִּֽי־עָל֥וּ הַמְּלָכִ֖ים לְהִלָּ֣חֶם בָּ֑ם</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>**wekhol-mo'av** shame'u ki-'alu hammelakhim lehillahem bam</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>**and all the Moabites** they heard that they came the kings to fight against them</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>**Now** when **all the Moabites** heard that the kings had come to fight against them</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

* 2SA 18:18
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd" align="right"><td><b>וְאַבְשָׁלֹ֣ם</b> לָקַ֗ח וַיַּצֶּב־ל֤וֹ בְחַיָּו אֶת־מַצֶּ֙בֶת֙</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>**we'avshalom** laqah wayyatsev-lo vehayyaw 'eth-matseveth</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>**and Absalom** had taken and he built for him in his life a pillar</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>**Now Absalom**, while still alive, had built for himself a large stone pillar</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
