# participle_active Article
Properly speaking, participles in Biblical Hebrew are verbal nouns. They conjugate in the various stem formations like the infinitive forms.  They also inflect for person and gender like both adjectives and nouns.  Furthermore, they can also appear in either the absolute state or the construct state, like nouns.  Thus, active participles are extremely flexible in their grammatical use and can function as a verbal complement, a finite verb, an adjective, or a noun.  In most cases, the context will clearly show how the participle is being used in the sentence.  Generally speaking, the meaning of the participle is clear even in cases where its specific grammatical function cannot be determined precisely.   

## Form

## Function
It is most helpful to classify participles according to their function in the whole sentence: as a verb (or verbal complement); as an adjective; or as a noun.  Participles can function independently as their own grammatical entity, but they often introduce entire clauses that function either as adjectives or nouns.  When used verbally, the active participle is closely related in meaning to the prefix conjugation; they are both often used to describe frequentive or durative action.

The active participle can function in a sentence in any of the following ways:

#### Functions as a verbal complement



#### Functions as a finite verb
When a participle functions as a verb, the subject precedes rather than follows (as in normal Hebrew word order for finite verbs).  A verbal participal can express frequentive, durative, or imminent action in past time, present time, or future time.

#### Functions as a verbal [adjective](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/adjective/02.md)
When functioning as an adjective, a participle follows the noun in the attributive position and matches the noun in gender, number, and definiteness.  The participle can either function as an adjective by itself or introduce a clause that functions as an adjective.
