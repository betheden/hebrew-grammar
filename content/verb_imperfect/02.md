# verb_imperfect Article
Generally speaking, in Biblical Hebrew the imperfect form is used to describe either actions that are not completed or actions that occurr in the present/future from the perspective of the writer/speaker.  However, the imperfect form is also used to describe several other kinds of actions as determined by the context, including commands, potential actions/events, and desirable actions/events.  The imperfect form is used with the negation particle לֹא to express an *absolute* prohibition.

When the conjunction is added to the imperfect form as a prefix, the meaning is the same as a normal imperfect form with the conjunction.  This is different from the Sequential Imperfect form, which utilizes a specialized form of the conjunction and contains a different meaning.  Sometimes the imperfect verb occurs within a clause after another finite verb.  In these cases, the context must determine whether the imperfect verb is complementing the main verb or whether the imperfect verb is communicating its own verbal idea.

The imperfect form can indicate any of the following kinds of actions:

#### 1) Future actions, events, or expectations
