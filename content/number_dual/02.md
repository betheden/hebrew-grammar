Both masculine and feminine dual nouns have the same ending,  יִִם ַ    They have a pataq before the yod and a hireq under it. 

Dual does not just mean two. It means that the two usually come in pairs. So, two men אֲנָשִׁ֑ים is plural, but two ears אָזְנַ֖יִם is dual.

Dual nouns use plural adjectives.
