Verb Imperative
===============

Summary
-------

An imperative verb is used to express direct commands, instructions, and
other similar actions with varying degrees of desirability as determined
by the context.

Article
-------

In Biblical Hebrew, the Imperative form is used to express positive
commands or instructions directed to another person(s). Thus, Imperative
:ref:`verb`
always appear only in the :ref:`person_second`.
(Similarly,
:ref:`verb_cohortative`
appear only in the :ref:`person_first`,
and
:ref:`verb_jussive`
usually appear in the :ref:`person_third`.)
Imperative verbs can express actions with varying degrees of
desirability, including instructions, requests, permissions,
invitations, assurances, wishes, etc. The context must determine the
nuanced meaning of each instance of an Imperative verb.

Biblical Hebrew does not use the Imperative form to express negative
commands. Rather, prohibitions are expressed either with the :ref:`verb_imperfect`
(with :ref:`particle_negative-lo`)
or with a Jussive verb in the 2nd person (with the :ref:`particle_negative-al`).
Occasionally, the Imperative form will appear with a :ref:`suffix_paragogic_he`;
in these cases, the meaning of the ה suffix is unknown.
