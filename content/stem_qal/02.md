# stem_qal Article
The Qal form is the simplest of all the verbal [stem](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem/02.md) formations in Biblical Hebrew.  All the other stem formations are derived from the form of the Qal stem. It is by far the most common form of a [verb](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/verb/02.md), and it almost always expresses either simple action (for dynamic verbs) or stative action (for stative verbs). In English, stative verbs require the helping verb "to be" for proper translation value (see example).  In Biblical Hebrew, the stative nature of the verb is indicated by the verb itself without requiring any additional helping verbs.
