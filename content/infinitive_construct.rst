Infinitive Construct
====================

Summary
-------

The infinitive construct is a non-finite verbal form that usually functions as a verbal complement, providing extra
information regarding the purpose, result, or temporal frame of the
verbal action of the main verb. In rare cases, the infinitive construct
functions independently as a noun.

The infinitive construct generally functions as a verbal complement to a
:ref:`verb-finite-verbs`,
but in rare cases it also functions independently as a :ref:`noun`.
The infinitive construct is described as being in the construct state
because it can occur in various constructions with prepositions,
:ref:`suffix`,
and other
:ref:`noun`
in a construct chain. The infinitive construct generally has only one
form in each
:ref:`stem`
(Qal, Niphal, Piel, etc.), and it does not conjugate according to
person, gender, or number as do the finite verb forms.

Function
--------

The infinitive construct can carry the following range of meanings.

Expresses purpose, result, or complementary action of a main verb (with preposition לְ)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is by far the most common use of the infinitive construct, as a
standard grammatical infinitive.

.. note:: The infinitive construct can also
          be used with other prepositions to complement the main verb (such as the
          preposition עַל in the example below).

In the following example, the infinitive construct is expressing
purpose for the action of the main verb.

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 11:5

  וַיֵּ֣רֶד יְהוָ֔ה **לִרְאֹ֥ת** אֶת־הָעִ֖יר וְאֶת־הַמִּגְדָּ֑ל
  wayyered yehwah **lir'oth** 'eth-ha'ir we'eth-hammigdal
  "and-he-came-down Yahweh **to-see** [dir.obj]\_the-city
     and-[dir.obj]\_the-tower"
  So Yahweh came down **to see** the city and the tower

In the following example, the infinitive construct is expressing
the result of the action of the main verb.

.. csv-table:: Example: EXO 3:4

  וַיַּ֥רְא יְהוָ֖ה כִּ֣י סָ֣ר לִרְא֑וֹת
  wayyar yehwah ki sar **lir'oth**
  and-he-saw Yahweh that he-had-turned-aside **to-see**
  When Yahweh saw that he had turned aside **to look**

In the following example, the infinitive construct is expressing
the complementary action of the main verb.

.. csv-table:: Example: EXO 3:8

  "וָאֵרֵ֞ד **לְהַצִּיל֣וֹ**\ ׀ מִיַּ֣ד מִצְרַ֗יִם **וּֽלְהַעֲלֹתוֹ֮**
     מִן־הָאָ֣רֶץ הַהִוא֒"
  "wa'ered **lehatsilo** miyyad mitsrayim **uleha'alotho** min-ha'arets
     hahiw'"
  "and-I-have-come-down **to-deliver-them** from-hand-of Egypt
     **and-to-bring-them-up** from-the-land the-that"
  "I have come down **to free them** from the Egyptians' power and **to
     bring them up** from that land"

In the following example, the infinitive construct is expressing
complementary action, but with a more nuanced meaning.

.. csv-table:: Example: 1SA 14:33

  הִנֵּ֥ה הָעָ֛ם חֹטִ֥אים לַֽיהוָ֖ה **לֶאֱכֹ֣ל** עַל־הַדָּ֑ם
  hinneh ha'am hotiym layhwah **le'ekhol** 'al-haddam
  behold the-people are-sinning to-Yahweh **to-eat** on\_the-blood
  "Look, the people are sinning against Yahweh **by eating** with the
     blood."

In the following example, the infinitive construct with preposition עַל to
express purpose for the action of the main verb.

.. csv-table:: Example: AMO 1:11

  לֹ֣א אֲשִׁיבֶ֑נּוּ עַל־\ **רָדְפ֨וֹ** בַחֶ֤רֶב אָחִיו֙
  lo 'ashivennu 'al-**rodfo** vaherev 'ahiw
  "not I-will-revoke-it on\_\ **his-pursuing** with-the-sword
     his-brother"
  "I will not turn away punishment, because **he pursued** his brother
     with the sword"

Provides temporal reference for the action of the main verb (with various prepositions)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The infinitive construct can be used with other prepositions (besides
those included below) to provide temporal reference. In those cases, the
context and the meaning of the preposition generally make clear the
specific temporal nuance being indicated.

Infinitive construct with preposition בְּ to express simultaneous action:

.. csv-table:: Example: 1SA 2:27

  "הֲנִגְלֹ֤ה נִגְלֵ֙יתִי֙ אֶל־בֵּ֣ית אָבִ֔יךָ **בִּֽהְיוֹתָ֥ם**
     בְּמִצְרַ֖יִם"
  hanigloh niglethiy 'el-beth 'avikha **biheyotham** bemitsrayim
  "[quest.]-indeed I-revealed-myself to\_house-of your-father
     **while-they-were** in-Egypt"
  "Did I not reveal myself to the house of your ancestor, **when they
     were** in Egypt?"

Infinitive construct with preposition כְּ to express commencing action:

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 12:14

  וַיְהִ֕י **כְּב֥וֹא** אַבְרָ֖ם מִצְרָ֑יְמָה
  wayhi **kevo** 'avram mitsraymah
  and-it-happened **as-coming** Abram to-Egypt
  It came about that **when** Abram **entered** into Egypt

Infinitive construct with preposition עַד to express durative action (until a
   specified time of ending):

.. csv-table:: Example: JDG 6:18

  וַיֹּאמַ֕ר אָנֹכִ֥י אֵשֵׁ֖ב עַ֥ד שׁוּבֶֽךָ
  wayyomar 'anokhi 'eshev 'ad **shuvekha**
  and-he-said myself I-will-remain until **you-return**
  "Yahweh said, ""I will wait until **you return**"""

Functions as a :ref:`noun`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The infinitive construct sometimes functions as an independent
:ref:`noun`.

.. csv-table:: Example: 1SA 15:22

  שְׁמֹ֙עַ֙ מִזֶּ֣בַח ט֔וֹב
  **shemo'a** mizzevah tov
  **obeying** from-sacrifice good
  **Obedience** is better than sacrifice

The infinitive construct may also introduce an entire clause that functions
as a noun.

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 2:17

  כִּ֗י בְּי֛וֹם **אֲכָלְךָ֥** מִמֶּ֖נּוּ מ֥וֹת תָּמֽוּת
  ki beyom **'akholkha** mimmennu moth tamuth
  for in-day-of **your-eating** from-it dying you-will-die
  "for on the day that **you eat** from it, you will surely die"

Introduces direct speech (אמר + לְ)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The infinitive construct of אמר with preposition לְ is used to introduce direct speech.

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 1:22

  וַיְבָ֧רֶךְ אֹתָ֛ם אֱלֹהִ֖ים לֵאמֹ֑ר
  wayvarekh 'otham 'elohim **lemor**
  and-he-blessed [dir.obj]-them God **to-say**
  "God blessed them, **saying**"

Regarding a :ref:`suffix_pronominal`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the infinitive construct takes a pronominal suffix, that suffix can
be either the subject or the object of the infinitive itself (not the
main verb), as determined by the context.

The following example is an infinitive construct with suffix as *subject*
of the action.

.. csv-table:: JER 2:17

  הֲלוֹא־זֹ֖את תַּעֲשֶׂה־לָּ֑ךְ **עָזְבֵךְ֙** אֶת־יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹהַ֔יִךְ
  halo-zoth ta'aseh-llakh **'ozvekh** 'eth-yehwah 'elohayikh
  "[quest.]-not\_this you-have-done\_to-yourself **your-forsaking**
     [dir.obj]\_Yahweh your-God"
  "Did you not do this to yourselves when **you abandoned** Yahweh your
     God?"

The following example is an infinitive construct with suffix as *object*
of the action.

.. csv-table:: Example: RUT 1:16

  וַתֹּ֤אמֶר רוּת֙ אַל־תִּפְגְּעִי־בִ֔י לְעָזְבֵ֖ךְ
  wattomer ruth 'al-tifge'i-vi **le'ozvekh**
  and-she-said Ruth not\_you-press\_on-me **to-forsake-you**
  "But Ruth said, ""Do not make me **go away from you**"
