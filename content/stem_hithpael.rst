Stem Hithpael
=============

Summary
-------

The Hithpael stem is related to the Piel stem formation, and it
generally expresses the reflexive voice of the meaning of a verb in the
Piel stem.

Article
-------

The Hithpael stem is formed from the :ref:`stem_piel`
by adding the reflexive prefix (הִתְ) and changing the vowel under the
1st radical. Like the Piel and Pual
:ref:`stem`,
it usually has a daghesh in the 2nd radical of the
:ref:`verb`.
Generally speaking, the Hithpael stem expresses the reflexive voice of
the meaning of a verb in the Piel stem. However, the Hithpael stem is
quite flexible in its use and can express other kinds of verbal action,
depending on the context and the specific verb.

Function
--------

The Hithpael stem can express any of the following kinds of verbal
action:

Expresses the reflexive voice of the Piel stem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For most verbs that appear in both the Piel and Hithpael stems in
Biblical Hebrew, the Hithpael stem expresses the same kind of action as
the Piel stem (simple, intensive, resultative, causative, etc.) but in
reflexive voice. (See the article on the :ref:`stem_niphal`
for the definition of reflexive voice.) A good example is the verb
יָדַע. In the Qal stem, the verb יָדַע means "to know" (simple action,
active voice). But in the Piel stem, the verb יָדַע means "to make
known" (causative action, active voice). Thus, in the Hithpael stem, the
verb יָדַע means "to make oneself known" (causative action, reflexive
voice).

-  GEN 45:1

.. csv-table::

  בְּהִתְוַדַּ֥ע יוֹסֵ֖ף אֶל־אֶחָֽיו
  **behithwadda**' yosef 'el-'ehayw
  **when-making-himself-known** Joseph to\_his-brothers
  when Joseph **made himself known** to his brothers

-  ISA 8:9 –– *direct* reflexive action, meaning that the verbal subject
   is also the *direct object* of the verb

.. csv-table::

  הִתְאַזְּר֣וּ וָחֹ֔תּוּ
  **hith'azzeru** wahottu
  **gird-yourselves** and-be-dismayed
  **arm yourselves** and be broken in pieces

-  1SA 18:4 –– *indirect* reflexive action, meaning that the verbal
   subject is also the *indirect object* of the verb

  וַיִּתְפַּשֵּׁט יְהוֹנָתָן אֶת־הַמְּעִיל

  Jonathan **took off** the robe

Expresses simple reflexive action
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Hithpael stem can be used to express simple reflexive action in two
ways. First, the Hithpael stem can express a simple action in reflexive
voice. In these cases, usually the Hithpael stem functions as the
reflexive voice of the *Qal* (or perhaps Niphal) stem rather than the
*Piel* stem. This is the case with the verb אָבַל ("to mourn"), as shown
in the example below. Secondly, the Hithpael stem can also express
simple action of a verb that is reflexive by its very nature. In these
rare cases, usually the verb appears *only* in the Hithpael stem in
Biblical Hebrew. This is the case with the verb אָפַק ("to constrain
oneself"), as shown in the example below.

-  GEN 37:34 –– expressing simple action "to mourn" (in reflexive voice,
   meaning *to mourn physically* via bodily actions)

.. csv-table::

  וַיִּתְאַבֵּ֥ל עַל־בְּנ֖וֹ יָמִ֥ים רַבִּֽים
  **wayyith'abbel** 'al-beno yamim rabbim
  **And-he-mourned** over\_his-son days many
  **He mourned** for his son many days.

-  ISA 45:1 –– expressing simple action "to constrain oneself"

.. csv-table::

  וְלֹֽא־יָכֹ֨ל יוֹסֵ֜ף לְהִתְאַפֵּ֗ק
  welo-yakhol yosef **lehith'appeq**
  And-not\_he-was-able Joseph **to-restrain-himself**
  Then Joseph could not **control himself**

Expresses various other kinds of verbal action
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes the Hithpael form functions in ways that do not follow the
strictly the reflexive conventions of the Hithpael stem as listed above.
Some verbs use the Hithpael stem to describe reciprocal action, middle
action, passive action, and/or perhaps even stative or other kinds of
verbal action. (See the article on the :ref:`stem_niphal`
for the definitions of these kinds of verbal action.) A dictionary or
lexicon will indicate the correct meaning in these instances of the
Hithpael stem.

-  GEN 42:1 –– expressing reciprocal action

.. csv-table::

  לָ֫מָּה **תִּתְרָאוּ**\ ׃
  lammah **tithra'u**
  Why **you-look-at-each-other**
  Why **do you look at one another**?

-  PRO 31:30 –– expressing passive (or possibly stative) action

.. csv-table::

  הִיא **הִתְהַלָּל**\ ׃
  hi **hithhallal**
  she **is-praised**.
  she **will be praised**.

-  Gen 3:8 –– the Hithpael form of the verb הָלַךְ expresses
   *reciprocating* action (meaning, *going back and forth*)

-  DEU 1:37 –– the Hithpael form of the verb אָנַף ("to be angry") is
   always used in reference to Yahweh
