[Adjectives](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/adjective/02.md) agree with the gender of the [noun](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/noun/02.md) they refer to.

The gender of a **finite verb** agrees with its subject, namely the person or object that does the action or the person or object whose state is described by the [verb](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/verb/02.md) **if the verb is active. If the verb is passive, the gender of the verb agrees with the person or the object that undergoes or receives the action (the direct object).**
