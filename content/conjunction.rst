Conjunction
===========

Summary
-------

Conjunctions connect words, phrases, sentences, or paragraphs. The most common conjunctions in English are
"and," "or," "but," and "for."  Some particles in Biblical Hebrew are closely related to conjunctions.

Article
-------

Biblical Hebrew contains only one primary conjunction (the prefix וְ),
but a whole family of other words also function as conjunctions. A
conjunction is a word that shows a relationship between two different
words, phrases, sentences, or even entire paragraphs. In Biblical Hebrew, :ref:`particles<particle>`
and conjunctions are often combined with each other to form compound conjunctions.
Compound conjunctions should not be considered merely as the sum of the
components, but rather as a single grammatical entity with its own range
of meanings which may or may not be different than the individual
component words.

Generally, there are eight different kinds of conjunctions in Biblical Hebrew: :ref:`conjunctive<conjunction-conjunctive>` ("and");
:ref:`alternative<conjunction-alternative>` ("or"); :ref:`contrastive<conjunction-contrastive>` ("but");
:ref:`causal<conjunction-causal>` ("for"); :ref:`conditional<conjunction-conditional>` ("if");
:ref:`concessive<conjunction-concessive>` ("except"); :ref:`affirmative<conjunction-affirmative>` ("surely");
:ref:`restrictive<conjunction-restrictive>` ("only"). Many conjunctions in Biblical Hebrew have potential to function in multiple categories.

Sentences in Biblical Hebrew often begin with the conjunction ו (as either a consonant or a shureq vowel).
This conjunction וְ ("and") cannot stand alone as an independent word but must be connected to another word as a prefix.
This can be added to a :ref:`noun<noun>`, a :ref:`verb<verb>`, a :ref:`pronoun<pronoun>`, or a :ref:`particle<particle>`.
The shewa in וְ can lengthen to a vowel, usually pathah (when paired with the definite article) or qamets 
(when paired with both the article and a ה prefix), but others are also possible.

.. note:: The conjunction וְ is often left untranslated when it begins a
          sentence or clause, or when it appears within the sequential verbal
          forms (:ref:`verb_sequential_perfect` and :ref:`verb_sequential_imperfect`).
          Also, the conjunction is often added between every item of a list in
          Biblical Hebrew; but in English the וְ is not translated for each item.

-וְ

Form
~~~~

The conjunction וְ can appear either as a prefix to a word or particle,
or as part of a sequential verbal form.

.. csv-table:: Example: ZEC 3:3 –– as a prefix to a separate word

  וְעֹמֵ֖ד לִפְנֵ֥י הַמַּלְאָֽךְ‬
  **we'omed** lifne hammal'akh‬
  **and-he-was-standing** to-face-of the-angel
  **and he was standing** in front of the angel

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 1:13 –– as part of a sequential verbal form

  וַֽיְהִי־עֶ֥רֶב **וַֽיְהִי**\ ־בֹ֖קֶר י֥וֹם שְׁלִישִֽׁי׃
  **wayehi**-'erev **wayehi**\ voqer yom shelishi
  "**And-there-was**\ \_evening, **and-there-was**\ \_morning, day
     third."
  "**This was** evening and morning, the third day."

Function
~~~~~~~~

The conjunction וְ can express any of the following connective
relationships:

.. _conjunction-conjunctive:

Conjunctive
^^^^^^^^^^^

A conjunctive conjunction simply joins two words/phrases/sentences together and is usually translated as "and" in
English.  This kind of conjunction can be used either comparatively (joining similar ideas) or contrastively (joining dissimilar ideas).

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 2:17

  וּמֵעֵ֗ץ הַדַּ֙עַת֙ ט֣וֹב **וָרָ֔ע** לֹ֥א תֹאכַ֖ל מִמֶּ֑נּוּ
  ume'ets hadda'ath tov **wara'** lo thokhal mimmennu
  "But-from-tree-of the-knowledge-of good **and-evil** not you-shall-eat
     from-it"
  "But from the tree of the knowledge of good **and evil** you may not
     eat"

In Biblical Hebrew, when a conjunctive conjunction connects two events that happen at the same time, it has a similar meaning to a conditional conjunction expressing an actual condition. In these cases, the conjunction 
can be translated as “while” or “when” in English.

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 1:5

  "וַיִּקְרָ֨א אֱלֹהִ֤ים ׀ לָאוֹר֙ י֔וֹם **וְלַחֹ֖שֶׁךְ** קָ֣רָא
     לָ֑יְלָה"
  wayyiqra 'elohim la'or yom **welahoshekh** qara laylah
  "And-he-called God to-the-light day **and-to-the-darkness** he-called
     night"
  "He named the light ""day,"" **and** he named **the darkness** ""night."""

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 45:14

  "וַיִּפֹּ֛ל עַל־צַוְּארֵ֥י בִנְיָמִֽן־אָחִ֖יו וַיֵּ֑בְךְּ
     **וּבִנְיָמִ֔ן** בָּכָ֖ה עַל־צַוָּארָֽיו׃"
  "wayyippol 'al-tsawwere vinyamin-'ahiw wayyevk **uvinyamin** bakhah
     'al-tsawwarayw"
  "And-he-fell on\_neck-of Benjamin\_his-brother and-he-wept
     **and-Benjamin** wept on\_his-neck."
  "He hugged his brother Benjamin's neck and wept, **while Benjamin**
     wept on his neck."

.. _conjunction-alternative:

Alternative
^^^^^^^^^^^

An alternative conjunction compares two words/phrases/sentences as alternates and is usually
translated as “or” in English.

.. csv-table:: Example: EXO 20:10

  לֹֽ֣א־תַעֲשֶׂ֨ה כָל־מְלָאכָ֜ה אַתָּ֣ה ׀ **וּבִנְךָֽ֣־וּבִתֶּ֗ךָ**  עַבְדְּךָ֤ **וַאֲמָֽתְךָ֙ וּבְהֶמְתֶּ֔ךָ וְגֵרְךָ֖** אֲשֶׁ֥ר  בִּשְׁעָרֶֽיךָ׃
  "lo-tha'aseh khol-melakhah 'attah **uvinkha-wwvittekha** 'avdekha
     **wa'amathekha uvehemtekha wegerekha** 'asher bish'areykha"
  "Not\_you-shall-do any\_work you **nor-your-son\_nor-your-daughter**
     your-male-servant
     **nor-your-female-servant nor-your-cattle nor-foreigner** who in-your-gates."
  "On it you must not do any work, you,
     **or your son, or your daughter, or your male servant, or your female servant, or your cattle, or the foreigner**
     who is within your gates."

.. _conjunction-contrastive:

Contrastive
^^^^^^^^^^^

A contrastive conjunction contrasts two words/phrases/sentences as different in some way and is usually translated as “but” in
English.

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 6:8

  וְנֹ֕חַ מָ֥צָא חֵ֖ן בְּעֵינֵ֥י יְהוָֽה׃
  **wenoah** matsa hen be'ene yehwah
  **But-Noah** found favor in-eyes-of Yahweh.
  **But Noah** found favor in the eyes of Yahweh.

.. _conjunction-affirmative:

Affirmative
^^^^^^^^^^^

An affirmative conjunction connects two words/phrases/sentences in such a way that the second either strengthens or adds to the first. This kind of conjunction is often translated
“even” (or is sometimes left untranslated) in English.

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 4:4

  וְהֶ֨בֶל הֵבִ֥יא גַם־ה֛וּא מִבְּכֹר֥וֹת צֹאנ֖וֹ וּמֵֽחֶלְבֵהֶ֑ן
  wehevel hevi gam-hu mibbekhoroth tsono **umehelvehen**
  "And-Abel brought also\_he from-firstborn-of his-flock **even-from-fat**"
  "As for Abel, he brought some of the firstborn of his flock **and some of the fat**"


ֹאו
----

The word אוֹ is the standard :ref:`alternative<conjunction-alternative>` conjunction in Biblical Hebrew,
usually translated as "or" in English.

.. csv-table:: Example: EXO 21:32

  אִם־עֶ֛בֶד יִגַּ֥ח הַשּׁ֖וֹר **א֣וֹ** אָמָ֑ה׃
  'im-'eved yiggah hashor **'o** 'amah
  If\_male-servant gores the-ox **or** female-servant
  If a bull attacks and gores a male **or** female slave

כִּי
----

.. include:: includes/ci_flexible.txt

The word כִּי is the standard causal conjunction in Biblical Hebrew, and
is usually translated as "for" in English. However, it is also commonly
used as a conditional conjunction (usually translated, "if"). Often,
כִּי is conditional when it occurs at the beginning of a sentence and
causal when it occurs in the middle (or toward the end) of a sentence,
but there are notable exceptions to this general rule.

.. _conjunction-causal:

Causal
~~~~~~

This is the most common use of the word כִּי. However, sometimes it is
extremely difficult to distinguish between a causal conjunction that
expresses purpose and one that expresses result. When כִּי functions as
a causal conjunction, it is often translated into English simply as
"for", which can express either purpose or result.

expresses purpose
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This means to express the purpose, reason, or cause for an action/event.
In English, this kind of causal conjunction is usually translated as
"for" or "because".

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 3:14

  "וַיֹּאמֶר֩ יְהֹוָ֨ה אֱלֹהִ֥ים ׀ אֶֽל־הַנָּחָשׁ֮ **כִּ֣י** עָשִׂ֣יתָ
     זֹּאת֒ אָר֤וּר אַתָּה֙׃"
  "wayyomer yehowah 'elohim 'el-hannahash **ki** 'asitha zoth 'arur
     'attah"
  "And-he-said Yahweh God to\_the-serpent **because** you-have-done this
     cursed you"
  "Then Yahweh God said to the snake, ""**Because** you did this, I will
     curse you."""

expresses result
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This means to express the result or intended outcome of an action/event.
In English, this kind of causal conjunction is usually translated as
"for" or “so that”.

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 20:10

  מָ֣ה רָאִ֔יתָ **כִּ֥י** עָשִׂ֖יתָ אֶת־הַדָּבָ֥ר הַזֶּֽה׃
  mah ra'itha **ki** 'asitha 'eth-haddavar hazzeh
  What did-you-see **so-that** you-did [dir.obj]\_the-thing the-this?
  What prompted you **to** do this thing?

Conditional
~~~~~~~~~~~

This is also a very common use of the word כִּי in Biblical Hebrew. This
conjunction can describe either a hypothetical condition or an actual
condition, as determined by the context.

expresses a hypothetical condition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A hypothetical condition expresses an imaginary action or event that has
not actually happened in reality. This kind of conditional conjunction
is usually translated as "if" in English. Hypothetical conditions have
potential to convey many different nuances of possibility and/or
desirability.

.. csv-table:: Example: 2KI 4:29

  "כִּֽי־תִמְצָ֥א אִישׁ֙ לֹ֣א תְבָרְכֶ֔נּוּ **וְכִֽי**\ ־יְבָרֶכְךָ֥
     אִ֖ישׁ לֹ֣א תַעֲנֶנּ֑וּ"
  "**ki**-thimtsa 'ish lo thevorkhennu **wekhi**-yevarekhkha 'ish lo
     tha'anennu"
  "**If**\ \_you-meet man not\_greet-him **and-if**\ \_greets-you man
     not answer-him."
  "**If** you meet any man, do not greet him, and **if** anyone greets
     you, do not answer him."

expresses an actual condition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An actual condition expresses an action or event that has actually
happened in reality, and is usually translated as "when" or "while" in
English. Usually, this kind of condition indicates something that is
happening concurrently with the main action/event being described, or
something that has happened in the past in certain circumstances.

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 27:1

  וַיְהִי֙ **כִּֽי**\ ־זָקֵ֣ן יִצְחָ֔ק וַתִּכְהֶ֥יןָ עֵינָ֖יו מֵרְאֹ֑ת
  wayhiy **ki**-zaqen yitshaq wattikhheyna 'enayw mere'oth
  "And-it-happened **when**\ \_old Isaac and-were-dim his-eyes
     from-seeing"
  **When** Isaac was old and his eyes were dim so that he could not see

Other uses
~~~~~~~~~~

The word כִּי can also express other conjunctive meanings, often as an
contrastive following a negated statement. If in doubt, it is
recommended to always consult a dictionary or lexicon for the exact
meaning of the word in any specific instance.

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 17:15

  "שָׂרַ֣י אִשְׁתְּךָ֔ לֹא־תִקְרָ֥א אֶת־שְׁמָ֖הּ שָׂרָ֑י **כִּ֥י**
     שָׂרָ֖ה שְׁמָֽהּ׃"
  saray 'ishtekha lo-thiqra 'eth-shemah saray **ki** sarah shemah
  "Sarai your-wife not\_call [dir.obj]\_her-name Sarai **but** Sarah
     her-name."
  "As for Sarai your wife, do not call her Sarai any more. **Instead**,
     her name will be Sarah."

אִם
----

.. note:: Like the word כִּי, the word אִם in Biblical Hebrew is also
          extremely flexible in its meaning. If in doubt, it is recommended to
          always consult a dictionary or lexicon for the exact meaning of the word
          in any specific instance.

.. _conjunction-conditional:

Conditional
~~~~~~~~~~~

The word אִם is the standard conditional conjunction in Biblical Hebrew.
It is most often used to describe a hypothetical condition and
translated as "if" in English. However, this term can can be nuanced and
translated in a variety of specific ways, and it can be joined with
various other particles to form different compound conjunctions.
Therefore, this word must be translated always with senstivity to the
context to express the correct nuance.

expresses a hypothetical condition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A hypothetical condition expresses an imaginary action or event that has
not actually happened in reality. This kind of conditional conjunction
is usually translated as "if" in English. Hypothetical conditions have
potential to convey many different nuances of possibility and/or
desirability.

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 18:26

  אִם־אֶמְצָ֥א בִסְדֹ֛ם חֲמִשִּׁ֥ים צַדִּיקִ֖ם בְּת֣וֹךְ הָעִ֑יר
  **'im**-'emtsa visdom hamishim tsaddiqim bethokh ha'ir
  **If**\ \_I-find in-Sodom fifty righteous in-place the-city
  **If** I find fifty people in Sodom who have done nothing wrong

The following example is a hypothetical condition as an affirmation of
an actual condition.

.. csv-table:: Example: JER 15:1

  אִם־יַעֲמֹ֨ד מֹשֶׁ֤ה וּשְׁמוּאֵל֙ לְפָנַ֔י
  **'im**-ya'amod mosheh ushemu'el lefanay
  **Though**\ \_stood Moses and-Samuel before-me
  **Even if** Moses or Samuel were standing in front of me

expresses an actual condition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An actual condition expresses an action or event that has actually
happened in reality, and is usually translated as "when" or "while" in
English. Usually, this kind of condition indicates something that is
happening concurrently with the main action/event being described, or
something that has happened in the past in certain circumstances.

.. csv-table:: Example: NUM 21:9

  "וְהָיָ֗ה **אִם**\ ־נָשַׁ֤ךְ הַנָּחָשׁ֙ אֶת־אִ֔ישׁ וְהִבִּ֛יט
     אֶל־נְחַ֥שׁ הַנְּחֹ֖שֶׁת וָחָֽי׃"
  "wehayah **'im**-nashakh hannahash 'eth-'ish wehibbit 'el-nehash
     hannehosheth wahay"
  "And-it-happened **when**\ \_he-had-bitten the-serpent [dir.obj]\_man
     and-he-looked to\_serpent-of the-bronze and-he-lived"
  "**When** a snake bit any person, if he looked at the bronze snake, he
     survived."

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 31:8

  "אִם־כֹּ֣ה יֹאמַ֗ר נְקֻדִּים֙ יִהְיֶ֣ה שְׂכָרֶ֔ךָ וְיָלְד֥וּ
     כָל־הַצֹּ֖אן נְקֻדִּ֑ים"
  "**'im**-koh yomar nequddim yihyeh sekharekha weyoldu khol-hatson
     nequddim"
  "**When**\ \_thus he-said speckled-ones it-will-be your-wages
     and-they-bore all\_the-flock speckled-ones"
  "**If** he said, 'The speckled animals will be your wages,' then all
     the flock bore speckled young."

:ref:`Alternative<conjunction-alternative>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This use of the conjunction אִם is often found in a question and is
usually translated as "or" in English.

.. csv-table:: Example: JOS 5:13

  הֲלָ֥נוּ אַתָּ֖ה **אִם**\ ־לְצָרֵֽינוּ׃
  halanu 'attah **'im**-letsarenu
  Are-for-us you **or**\ \_for-our-enemies?
  Are you for us **or** for our enemies?

וְעַתָּה
----

The word עַתָּה ("now") in Biblical Hebrew often functions as a temporal adverb
in a sentence. However, when עַתָּה appears at the beginning of a
sentence or clause, it usually functions not as an adverb but as a
conjunction, either standing alone or as a compound conjunction (when
paired with the prefix וְ or with particles such as גַּם or כִּי). In
either case, the term functions as a type of :ref:`causal<conjunction-causal>` conjunction, indicating that
what follows is based upon what has come before. This conjunction must
be translated always with great sensitivity to the context to express
the correct nuance; in English, this conjunction can be translated as
"now", "so", "so now", "and now", "therefore", and others. A dictionary
or lexicon will indicate the specific nuance of this term in individual
contexts.

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 31:13 –– as a stand-alone conjunction

  עַתָּ֗ה ק֥וּם צֵא֙ מִן־הָאָ֣רֶץ הַזֹּ֔את
  **'attah** qum tse' min-ha'arets hazzoth
  **Now** rise-up go-out from\_the-land the-this
  **Now** rise up and leave this land

.. csv-table:: Example: 1KI 8:26 –– with prefix וְ

  "וְעַתָּ֖ה אֱלֹהֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל יֵאָ֤מֶן נָא֙ דְּבָרֶיךָ אֲשֶׁ֣ר
     דִּבַּ֔רְתָּ לְעַבְדְּךָ֖ דָּוִ֥ד אָבִֽי"
  "**we'attah** 'elohe yisra'el ye'amen na' devareykha 'asher dibbarta
     le'avdekha dawid 'avi"
  "**And-now** God-of Israel let-it-be-true [exh.prtc] your-words that
     you-spoke to-your-servant David my-father"
  "**Now then**, God of Israel, I pray that the promise you made to your
     servant David my father, will come true."

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 44:10 –– in compound conjunction with גַּם

  וַיֹּ֕אמֶר **גַּם־עַתָּ֥ה** כְדִבְרֵיכֶ֖ם כֶּן־ה֑וּא
  wayyomer **gam-'attah** khedivrekhem ken-hu
  And-he-said **also\_now** as-your-words thus\_it
  **Now also** let it be according to your words.

.. csv-table:: Example: 1SA 13:13 –– in compound conjunction with כִּי

  כִּ֣י עַתָּ֗ה הֵכִ֨ין יְהוָ֧ה אֶת־מַֽמְלַכְתְּךָ֛
  **ki 'attah** hekhin yehwah 'eth-mamelakhtekha
  **For now** he-established Yahweh [dir.obj]\_your-reign
  **For then** Yahweh would have established your rule

לֽוּ
----

This term is a :ref:`conditional<conjunction-conditional>` conjunction, similar to אִם but used only to
express hypothetical conditions. The word can also appear in the
alternate forms לוּא and לֻא. This conjunction either: 1) expresses a
condition that cannot (or probably will not) happen, usually translated
"if" in English; or 2) conveys a strong desire for something to happen
that cannot (or probably will not) be realized, usually translated "if
only" in English.

.. csv-table:: Example: JDG 13:23

  לוּ֩ חָפֵ֨ץ יְהוָ֤ה לַהֲמִיתֵ֙נוּ֙
  **lu** hafets yehwah lahamithenu
  **If** he-wanted Yahweh to-kill-us
  **If** Yahweh intended to kill us

.. csv-table:: Example: NUM 14:2

  לוּ֩־מַ֙תְנוּ֙ בְּאֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרַ֔יִם
  **lu**-mathnu be'erets mitsrayim
  **If-only** we-had-died in-the-land-of Egypt
  **We wish** we had died in the land of Egypt

פֶּן
----

This term is also a :ref:`conditional<conjunction-conditional>` conjunction, and it expresses a certain
kind of hypothetical condition. The word can be used in two different
ways: either 1) in warnings to express a potential condition that will
take place if the warning is not heeded, usually translated "lest" in
English; or 2) to express the reason for a certain action to prevent a
possible condition from taking place, usually translated as "so
that...not" (or similar phrasing) in English.

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 3:3

  וְלֹ֥א תִגְּע֖וּ בּ֑וֹ **פֶּן**\ ־תְּמֻתֽוּן׃
  welo thigge'u bo **pen**-temuthun
  and-not you-will-touch in-it **so-that-not**\ \_you-will-die
  "nor may you touch it, **or** you will die."

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 31:24

  "הִשָּׁ֧מֶר לְךָ֛ **פֶּן**\ ־תְּדַבֵּ֥ר עִֽם־יַעֲקֹ֖ב מִטּ֥וֹב
     עַד־רָֽע"
  hishamer lekha **pen**-tedabber 'im-ya'aqov mittov 'ad-ra'
  "Be-guarded to-you **so-that-not**\ \_you-speak with\_Jacob from-good
     until\_bad."
  Be careful **that** you speak to Jacob **neither** good **nor** bad.

.. _conjunction-restrictive:

רַק
----

The word רַק is the standard restrictive conjunction in Biblical Hebrew.  A restrictive conjunction sets apart a clause or phrase
as unique within its context. Sometimes this restrictive function emphasizes a particular item as the most important or most
prominent; in these cases, the conjunction is similar in meaning to an :ref:`affirmative<conjunction-affirmative>` conjunction.
At other times, however, this restrictive function introduces a particular limitation to something previously expressed; in
these cases, this conjunction is similar in meaning to a :ref:`concessive<conjunction-concessive>` conjunction.  



.. _conjunction-compound:

Compound conjunctions
---------------------

.. note:: Sometimes multiple conjunctions or particles appear
          together but do NOT form a compound conjunction; in such cases, each
          word retains its individual range of meanings. These instances must be
          determined from the context. If in doubt, consult a dictionary or
          lexicon for the exact meaning of any specific occurrence.

.. _conjunction-concessive:

כִּי אִם
~~~~~~~~

Sometimes the words כִּי and אִם are paired together to form a compound conjunction that functions most often as a strong contrastive
or a strong concessive ("except"). In English, it is usually translated as "but",
"but if", or "except". It is recommended to always consult a dictionary
or lexicon for the exact meaning of any specific occurrence of this
compound conjunction.

.. csv-table:: Example: 2KI 23:9

  כִּ֛י אִם־אָכְל֥וּ מַצֹּ֖ות בְּתֹ֥וךְ אֲחֵיהֶֽם׃
  **ki 'im**-'okhlu matsowth bethowkh 'ahehem
  **but if**\ \_they-ate unleavened-bread in-midst-of their-brothers.
  **but** they ate unleavened bread among their brothers.

אַף כִּי
~~~~~~~~

Sometimes the words אַף and כִּי are paired together to form a compound
conjunction that functions as a strong :ref:`affirmative<conjunction-affirmative>`.  This compound
conjunction can appear with or without the prefix conjunction וְ
("and").


.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 3:1

  אַ֚ף כִּֽי־אָמַ֣ר אֱלֹהִ֔ים
  **'af ki**-'amar 'elohim
  **indeed** he-has-said God
  Has God **really** said

.. csv-table:: Example: EZK 23:40

  וְאַ֗ף כִּ֤י־אַחֲרֵ֥י מוֹתִֽי׃
  **we'af ki**-'ahare mothi
  **and-more** after my-death
  **how much more** after my death?
