# stem_palel Article

The Palel stem is a variation of the [Piel stem](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_piel/02.md) and expresses the same range of verbal action.  In the Piel stem, the second consonant is doubled by a daghesh; but for some weak verbs, the third consonant is doubled by writing it twice, thus forming the Palel stem.  It is an extremely rare verbal from in Biblical Hebrew.  It is recommended to *always* consult a dictionary or lexicon for the precise nuance of any verb in the Palel stem.
