Stem Polel
==========

Summary
-------

The Polel is a rare stem formation that is similar to the Piel and
expresses the same range of meanings.

Article
-------

The Polel :ref:`stem<stem>` is a variation of the :ref:`Piel<stem_piel>`
and has potential to express the same range of verbal action. The Polel
stem is formed from the Piel stem by dropping the 2nd radical and
repeating the 3rd radical (with a vowel change). It is a :ref:`rare stem formation<stem-uncommon>`
in Biblical Hebrew.

.. include:: includes/consult_dictionary.txt

.. warning:: The Polel stem appears exactly the same as the :ref:`Polal<stem_polal>` stem in all
          conjugations; only the 3rd-person masculine singular forms are
          different.
