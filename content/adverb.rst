Adverb
======

Summary
-------

An adverb is a word that describes a verb, or sometimes describes a sentence as a whole. Some 
particles in Biblical Hebrew are closely related to adverbs.

.. note:: Because there are not many direct adverbs in Biblical Hebrew, other kinds of words often function as adverbs.

Article
-------

Biblical Hebrew does not contain many words that are classified directly
as adverbs. However, many different kinds of words can
function as adverbs, including an
:ref:`infinitive absolute<infinitive_absolute>`, an
:ref:`adjective<adjective>`,
or even a
:ref:`noun<noun>`.

Many :ref:`particles<particle>` are closely related to adverbs in Biblical Hebrew. A
general rule is that when a particle occurs after the verb, it functions
as an adverb; but when a particle appears before the verb, then it
functions in some other way (usually as a conjunction or a discourse marker). But
this rule is not universal; sometimes both adverbs and particles
can appear before the verb rather than after the verb, as in the
example below (GEN 32:11).

Describes a verb
----------------

There are several different ways that an adverb can describe a verb. Many adverbs in Biblical Hebrew have the potential to serve multiple
functions. For example, כֹּה can function as an adverb of place, an
adverb of time, or an adverb of manner; פֹּה can function as an adverb
of time or an adverb of place, etc.

.. _adverb-sentential:

Describes an entire clause or sentence
--------------------------------------

Sometimes an adverb describes an entire clause or sentence rather than the individual verb.
When an adverb functions in this way, it is called a sentential adverb.
Sentential adverbs are closely related to :ref:`conjunctions<conjunction>`.

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 9:4 ––  אַךְ as a restrictive adverb

  אַךְ־בָּשָׂ֕ר בְּנַפְשׁ֥וֹ דָמ֖וֹ לֹ֥א תֹאכֵֽלוּ׃

  **only** if\_listening you-will-listen to-voice-of Yahweh your-God
  if **only** you diligently listen to the voice of Yahweh your God

.. _adverb-nominal:

Functions as a noun
-------------------

In Biblical Hebrew, sometimes an adverb functions as a noun rather than functioning to describe the verb.
This is called a nominal adverb.

.. csv-table:: Example: ISA 65:16

  יִשָּׁבַ֖ע בֵּאלֹהֵ֣י אָמֵ֑ן
  
  he-will-swear by-God-of **Amen**
  "Whoever ... will swear by me, the God of **truth**"

Because Biblical Hebrew does not contain many adverbs, sometimes other kinds of words can function as adverbs.
