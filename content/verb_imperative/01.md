# verb_imperative Glossary
- The imperative form is used to express direct commands, instructions, or other similar actions with varying degrees of desirability, depending on the context.
- The imperative form only expresses positive commands, never negative commands.  Negative commands are expressed using either the imperfect form (see article for Imperfect verbs) or the jussive form (see article for Jussive verbs).
