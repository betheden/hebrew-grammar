# stem_pual Article
The Pual [stem](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem/02.md) is the passive form of the Piel stem formation in Biblical Hebrew.  The Pual stem is usually indicated by a daghesh in the middle consonsant of the [verb](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/verb/02.md) and a qibbuts vowel under the initial consonant. Generally speaking, the Pual stem expresses the passive sense of the meaning of a verb in the Piel stem.  Scholars sometimes disagree whether certain verb forms should be classified as belonging to the Pual stem or the Qal Passive stem.  In English, passive action is expressed using the helping verb "to be." In Biblical Hebrew, the passive nature of the verbal action is expressed by the Pual form of the verb itself without any helping verbs.

NOTE: It is recommended to *always* consult a dictionary or lexicon for the specific meaning of the Pual stem for any specific verb, because the Pual stem has potential to express many different kinds of action for various verbs in different contexts.

### Form

**[paradigm]**

### Function

The Pual stem can express any of the following kinds of verbal action:
 
#### Expresses the passive sense of the Piel stem
For most verbs that appear in both the Piel and Pual stems in Biblical Hebrew, the Pual stem will express the same kind of action as the Piel stem (simple, intensive, resultative, causative, etc.) but in its passive sense.  A good example is the verb בָּקַע.  In the Qal stem, the verb בָּקַע means "to cut open" or "to break open".  But in the Piel stem, the verb בָּקַע means "to rip open" (intensive action).  Thus, in the Pual stem, the verb בָּקַע means "to be ripped open" (passive intensive action).  

* JOS 9:4 –– Pual stem of בָּקַע, meaning "to be ripped open"; in Piel stem, means "to rip open"
<table border="1" class="docutils">

<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>וַיִּקְח֞וּ ... וְנֹאד֥וֹת יַ֙יִן֙ בָּלִ֔ים וּמְבֻקָּעִ֖ים וּמְצֹרָרִֽים</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>and they took ... and skins of wine worn-out **and being ripped open** and being mended</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>They also took old wine skins that were worn, **torn**, and had been repaired.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

* EZK 38:12 –– Pual stem of אָסַף, meaning "to be gathered"; in Piel stem, means "to gather"
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>וְאֶל־עַם֙ מְאֻסָּ֣ף מִגּוֹיִ֔ם</td>

<tr class="row-even"><td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>and to people **being gathered** from nations</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>...and against the people **gathered** from the nations,...</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

#### Expresses simple passive action
Intensive action means that the verbal action is strengthened in some way. A good example is the Hebrew verb שָׁבַר.  In the Qal stem, the verb שָׁבַר means "to break". But in the Piel stem, the verb שָׁבַר means "to shatter" or "to break in pieces". A dictionary or lexicon will indicate an intensive nuance in comparison with the meaning of the verb in other stem formations.

<tr class="row-odd"><td>their altars you break down and their pillars **you shatter**</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>...you must break down their altars, **smash** their stone pillars,...</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

#### Expresses various kinds of passive or stative action
Sometimes the Pual form is used with specific verbs or in specific contexts to express a specialized meaning for the verbal action. In these instances, the context demonstrates that none of the normal meanings of the verbal action make sense. A dictionary or lexicon will indicate the correct meaning in these instances of the Pual stem.

Pual verbs have a doubled middle radical of the root, and it shows this with a dagesh in strong verbs. The dagesh is not there for weak or guttural middle radicals, nor when there is a shewa under it.

Pual verbs usually have qibbus under the first radical.
