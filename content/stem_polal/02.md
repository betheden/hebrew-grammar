# stem_polal Article
The Polal [stem](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem/02.md) is essentially identical to the [Pual stem](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_pual/02.md) in meaning (namely an intensive aspect with the passive voice), but its form is slightly different.

## Form
In the Pual, the second consonant is doubled by a Dagesh, but for some weak verbs, the second consonant gets doubled by writing it twice.
