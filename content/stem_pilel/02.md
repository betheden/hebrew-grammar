The Pilel stem is a variation of the [Piel stem](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_piel/02.md) and has potential to express the same range of verbal action.  It is the same stem formation as the [Palel](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_palel/02.md), only with a variant vocalization.  The Pilel stem is formed from the Piel stem by repeating the 3rd radical, thus making a verb that can appear to have 4 consonants.  It is an extremely rare verbal form in Biblical Hebrew. It is recommended to *always* consult a dictionary or lexicon for the precise nuance of any verb in the Pilel stem.
