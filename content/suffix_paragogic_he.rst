Suffix Paragogic He
===================

Summary
-------

The paragogic ה (he) suffix can only attach to an imperative verb and most likely expresses some kind of added emphasis to the
verb. However, the specific nature and meaning of this emphasis is unknown.

Article
-------

This suffix should not be confused with the cohortative verbal ending, although they appear exactly alike.  These suffixes are
distinguished by the form of the verb to which they are attached.  The paragogic ה suffix always attaches to an
:ref:`imperative verb<verb_imperative>` in Biblical Hebrew, whereas the cohortative qamets-he ending always attaches to an 
:ref:`imperfect<verb_imperfect>` verb to form the specific :ref:`cohortative<verb_cohortative>` verbal form.

Form
----

This suffix consists of a ה (he) consonant preceded by a qamets vowel.
