Particle Demonstrative
======================

Summary
-------

Demonstrative particles are used to draw attention to the reader or the
listener.

Article
-------

Hebrew only has a few demonstrative particles, the two most common ones
are הִנֵּה and הֵ֣ן. This particle can be preceded by a conjunction.
While הִנֵּה and הֵ֣ן are often translated, the function of a
demonstrative particle is to draw attention to what comes immediately
after it. Because the purpose of this particle is often to draw the
attention of the reader to the following word, the particle itself can
often be left untranslated. This is similar to the :ref:`particle_direct_object_marker`
in the sense that the point of a demonstrative particle is often its
function and not necessarily its translation value.

Independently

The demonstrative particle occurs at the beginning of a clause
