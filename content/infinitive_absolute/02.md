# infinitive_absolute Article
Of all the verbal conjugations in Biblical Hebrew, the infinitive absolute is the simplest in form but the most complex in function.  The infinitive absolute is described as being in the absolute state because it always stands entirely on its own as an independent word.  The form nevers take an article or conjunction, a prefix or suffix, or attached prepositions.  The infinitive absolute generally has only one form in each stem (Qal, Niphal, Piel, etc.), and it does not conjugate according to person, gender, or number as do the finite verb forms.  Grammatically, the infinitive absolute can function as an adverb, a noun, or even as a finite verb.  The context of an infinitive absolute must be carefully scrutinized to discern its precise meaning in each instance.

The infinitive absolute can express the following range of meanings:

#### Expresses certainty or intensity of verbal action
Most often, the infinitive absolute precedes a finite verb of the same root. When used in this way, the infinitive absolute functions adverbially, either assuring or intensifying the action of the main verb.
