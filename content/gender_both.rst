Gender Both
===========

Summary
-------

A word is classified as "both gender" if it contains both a masculine
and a feminine form, or if a single form is grammatically-masculine in
some contexts and grammatically-feminine in other contexts.

Article
-------

Some words appear in both a
:ref:`gender_masculine`
and a
:ref:`gender_feminine`
form. Other words have only one form, but that single form can be either
grammatically-masculine or grammatically-feminine. These kinds of words
are classified as "gender both", and they are usually nouns or
adjectives. Sometimes the context can determine the gender of a
particular instance of a "gender both" noun (see examples below for
שֶׁמֶשׁ), but sometimes the context is inconclusive (see example below for
נֹגַהּ).
