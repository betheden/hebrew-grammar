# adjective Article
An adjective describes a noun. It can describe an attribute without a verb, describe a noun with a linking verb, or act as a noun when one is not there.


Adjectives always match the noun they describe in gender and number. Because the gender of some nouns does not match their form, the adjective matches the gender of the noun, not its form. If the noun is dual, the adjective will be plural. If a noun is collective or if a plural noun refers to one person, the adjective may match the implied number rather than the form. 

1. The adjective describes an attribute if 
-the adjective and the noun are both definite or both indefinite
-the adjective comes after the noun

1 Sam 18:17 
בתּי הגּדולה	“my daughter the older” = “my older daughter”

2. The adjective is connected to a noun with a linking verb if
-the adjective is indefinite

2 Sam 14:20
ואדני חכם "and my lord wise” = “and my lord is wise”

Therefore, if the adjective is indefinite and comes after the noun, it is not clear if it describes and attribute or is connected to a noun with a linking verb.

3. If there is no noun, the adjective acts like one. 
Psalm 3:2
עלי קמים רבים “many are rising up against me” = “many people are rising up against me”

4. Compare 2 nouns
To compare two nouns, מן  is used. It can mean “more.”
Judges 14:18
מה-מּתוק מדּבשׁ, ומה עז מארי  “What sweet than honey, and what strong than lion” = “What is sweeter than honey, and what is stronger than a lion”

5. Compare 3 or more nouns
-definite
1 Sam 16:11
הקּטן "the young” = “the youngest”

-if the next word has the prefix ב followed by a plural noun
Song 1:8 
היּפה בּנּשׁים "the fair among women” = “the fairest among women”

-if the noun is in construct. Often the noun may be repeated, first as single, then plural. 
Exod 26:33
קדשׁ הקּדשׁים "holy of the holy” = “the holiest place”

The noun may also have a pronominal suffix
Mi 7:4
טובם  "their good” = “the best of them”


-divine epithet 
Jon 3:3
 עיר-גּדולה לאלהים "a city great to Elohim” = “a very great city”

- מן כל
מן  compares two things, but מן כל compares many 
Gen 3:1 
 והנּחשׁ היה ערום מכּל חיּת השּׂדה = “the serpent was the most cunning of all the animals of the field” 

מאד = “very” when it follows an adjective
Gen 1:31
והנּה-טוב מאד
