## Article

In Biblical Hebrew, all [verbs](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/verb/02.md) have both a stem formation (Qal, Niphal, Piel, etc.) and a conjugation (Prefix Conjugation, Suffix Conjugation, Imperative, etc.). These work together like two "layers", and each layer supplies different information about the verb.
In Biblical Hebrew, there are seven major stems and several rare ones.

## Function
Here is a brief overview of the most common stems and their most common function:
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td></td><th>Active Voice</th><th>Passive/Reflexive Voice</th>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><th>Simple Action</th><td>Qal (simple action, active voice)</td><td>Niphal (simple action, passive voice)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><th>Causative Action</th><td>Hiphil (causative action, active voice)</td><td>Hophal (causative action, passive voice)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><th>Intensive Action</th><td>Piel (intensive action, active voice)</td><td>Pual (intensive action, passive voice)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><th>Intensive Action</th><td>-</td><td>Hithpael (intensive action, reflexive voice)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

NOTE: It is advised to *always* check both the dictionary entry for the particular stem and the context to get the exact nuance. This is especially true for the Piel, Hiphil, Hophal, and Hithpael stems, which are often not easy to guess from the meaning of the Qal.

## Form
This is a brief overview on how to quickly recognize the simplest forms of each stem:

#### [Qal](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_qal/02.md)
The simplest form of the verb, often has "a" vowels (qamets or patah).

#### [Niphal](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_niphal/02.md)
Adds נִ (nun with hireq) to the beginning of the verb. If the form also adds a prefix (like in the prefix conjugation), the נ disappears and causes the 1st radical to double (with a daghesh).

#### [Piel](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_piel/02.md)
Here the 2nd radical of the verb is doubled (with a daghesh), and usually have a shewa or a hireq under the 1st radical.

#### [Pual](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_pual/02.md)
Also doubles the 2nd radical but often has a qibbuts under the 1st radical.

#### [Hiphil](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_hiphil/02.md)
Often has הִ (he with hireq) before the verb, or a patah under the letter that the form adds before the root.

#### [Hophal](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_hophal/02.md)
Also adds a ה before the verb, but with a qamets hatuf (or sometimes qibbuts) vowel.

#### [Hithpael](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_hithpael/02.md)
It adds הִתְ (he with hireq and taw with shewa) before the verb, and puts a qamets or patah under the 1st radical.

## Uncommon stems
Most of these stems occur only a few times in the Hebrew Bible. Their function is usually similar to one of the above stems, or a combination of two of them.
One simple rule that can help with a first guess as to its function is this: If it sounds similar to one of the seven common stems, it probably means something similar as well.

The uncommon stems are:
[Hishtaphel](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_hishtaphel/02.md) - [Hithpalpel](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_hithpalpel/02.md) - [Hithpoel](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_hithpoel/02.md) - [Hithpolel](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_hithpolel/02.md) - [Hothpaal](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_hothpaal/02.md) - [Nithpael](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_nithpael/02.md) - [Palel](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_palel/02.md) - [Pealal](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_pealal/02.md) - [Pilel](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_pilel/02.md) - [Pilpel](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_pilpel/02.md) - [Poal](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_poal/02.md) - [Poel](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_poel/02.md) - [Polal](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_polal/02.md) - [Polel](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_polel/02.md) - [Polpal](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_polpal/02.md) - [Pulal](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_pulal/02.md) - [Qal Passive](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_qal_passive/02.md) - [Tiphil](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_tiphil/02.md)
