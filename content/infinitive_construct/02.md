# infinitive_construct Article
The infinitive construct generally functions adverbially, modifying a finite verb, but it can also function independently as a verbal noun in rare cases.  The infinitive construct is described as being in the construct state because it can occur in various constructions with prepositions, suffixes, and other nouns in a construct chain. The infinitive construct generally has only one form in each stem (Qal, Niphal, Piel, etc.), and it does not conjugate according to person, gender, or number as do the finite verb forms.  

The infinitive construct may have a [suffixed pronoun](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/suffix_pronominal/02.md). Context shows if the pronoun is subjective or objective. 

* For example, in JER 2:17 עָזְבֵךְ֙ אֶת־יְהוָ֣ה the pronoun is doing the action, “your abandoning YHWH.” 

* But in RUT 1:16 לְעָזְבֵ֖ךְ לָשׁ֣וּב מֵאַחֲרָ֑יִךְ the pronoun is receiving the action, “to abandon you, to turn from following you.”

## Future
If the infinitive construct follows ל, it can describe an event which is about to happen.
This is the most common use.
