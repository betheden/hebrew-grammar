Adverb
======

Summary
-------

An adverb is a word that describes the verb, or sometimes describes the
sentence as a whole. Particles in Biblical Hebrew are closely related to
adverbs.

Article
-------

Biblical Hebrew does not contain many words that are classified directly
as adverbs. However, many different kinds of words have potential to
function as adverbs, including
:ref:`infinitive_absolute`,
:ref:`adjective`,
and even
:ref:`noun`.
Many adverbs in Biblical Hebrew have the potential to serve multiple
functions. For example, כֹּה can function as an adverb of place, an
adverb of time, or an adverb of manner; פֹּה can function as an adverb
of time or an adverb of place, etc.

Many particles are closely related to adverbs in Biblical Hebrew. A
general rule is that when a particle occurs after the verb, it functions
as an adverb; but when a particle appears before the verb, then it
functions in some other way (usually as a particle or conjunction). But
this rule is not universal; both adverbs and adverbial particles
sometimes appear before the verb rather than after the verb, as in the
example below (GEN 32:11).
