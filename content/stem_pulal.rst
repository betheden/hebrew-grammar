Form
----

The Pulal stem is a variation of the :ref:`stem_pual`
and expresses the passive voice of the verbal action of the :ref:`stem_pilel`
and/or the :ref:`stem_palel`.
The Pulal stem is formed from the Pual by repeating the 3rd radical
(with a vowel change), thus making a verb that appears to have 4
consonants. It is an extremely rare verbal form in Biblical Hebrew. Most
of the Pulal verbs found in the Hebrew Bible are from the root אָמַל
("to be weak").
