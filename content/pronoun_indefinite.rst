Pronoun Indefinite
==================

Summary
-------

An indefinite pronoun is a pronoun that doesn’t refer to anyone or
anything specific. Indefinite pronouns are usually translated as “who" or "whoever” (when referring to persons), or
“what” or "whatever" (when referring to objects).

Article
-------

There are two indefinite articles in Hebrew: מִי (for persons), and מָה
(for objects). They are identical in form to the :ref:`pronoun_interrogative`.
The context will make clear which one it is.

Form
----

Indefinite pronouns do not change their form based on number, gender, or
person. Their vowels can change a little bit based on with which sound
the next word begins.
