Particle Demonstrative
======================

Summary
-------

Demonstrative particles function to direct the attention of a listener or reader.

Article
-------

Biblical Hebrew has only a few demonstrative particles, with the two most common ones being הִנֵּה and הֵ֣ן. The specific function
of a demonstrative particle is to draw attention to whatever immediately follows the particle, either a single word or an entire
phrase. Similar to the :ref:`exhortation particle<particle_exhortation>`, demonstrative particles are sometimes left untranslated.
Demonstrative particles can stand alone or take a :ref:`pronominal suffix<suffix_pronominal>` and/or a prefixed
:ref:`conjunction<conjunction>`.  

Function

Directs the attention of the listener
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When used in direct speech, the demonstrative particle functions to direct the attention of the person listening to the speech.
This function of the demonstrative particle also serves to make a presentation of a person/thing from one person to another
(see GEN 12:19 below).

Directs the attention of the reader
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When used in narrative or poetry (not in direct speech), the demonstrative particles functions to direct the attention of the
person reading the text. This function of the demonstrative particle often directs the attention of the reader to a scene that
a person within the narrative is observing at that moment (see GEN 1:31 and GEN 8:13 below).

  הִנֵּ֤ה שְׂכָרֹו֙ אִתֹּ֔ו
  **hinneh** sekharow 'ittow
  **Look** his-reward with-him
  "**See**, his reward is with him"

  And-he-saw God [dir.obj]\_all\_that he-made **and-behold** \_good very
  God saw everything that he had made. **Behold,** it was very good.
