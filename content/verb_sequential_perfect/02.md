# verb_sequential_perfect Article
The sequential perfect form looks very similar to the normal perfect form, but it is a completely separate verbal form and must be treated as such. The sequential perfect form takes the same verbal endings as the perfect form but includes the conjunction *waw* (וְ "and") as a prefix. A sequential perfect verb does not function like a perfect verb. Rather, it acts like an *imperfect* verb, but with the added sense of being connected to an earlier verb to form a sequence of time or a sequence of thought. Sequential perfect verbs often appear in a series following a clause with an imperfect verb.

There is a difference between (1) the sequential perfect form, (2) a normal perfect form with the conjunction, and (3) a normal imperfect form with the conjunction. (1) and (2) look identical, so the reader must determine which one is being used in the text by examining the context.  (1) is also different than (3), although they can have similar meanings.  The sequential perfect verb [(1) above] forms a sequence with the verb in the clause before it, but the normal imperfect form [(3) above] with the conjunction does not.

The sequential perfect form can indicate any one of many different kinds of actions:
