# verb_cohortative Article
The cohortative form looks very similar to an imperfect form but functions in the sentence more like an imperative.  Cohortative verbs appear only in 1st person forms.  [Similarly, imperatives appear only in 2nd person forms, and jussives usually appear in 3rd person forms.]  **A cohortative verb does not carry the full force of a command ("We *must* do this!"), but it conveys a stronger meaning than a simple suggestion or statement of possibilty ("We *could* do this.").**  The meaning is somewhere in the middle.  In English, a cohortative is often translated with a helping verb such as "let" or "want" or "will," depending on the context (*"Let us do this!"* or *"I want to do this!"*).  Thus, the cohortative verb functions as an indirect command; the reader must examine the context to determine the strength of desirability being expressed in each specific instance.  **NOTE: In Biblical Hebrew, it is possible for the imperfect form to express a cohortative meaning** (see article on Imperfect verbs).

*[Editorial note: How are verbs being tagged where the imperfect form is functioning cohortatively?  Are they being tagged as "cohortative" or "imperfect"?  This makes a difference in how this article should be written.  I have written this as if they are tagged as "imperfect."  But if they are tagged as cohortative, then this section should be slightly altered.]*

**NOTE: The negation particle אַל is always used to express a negative cohortative in Biblical Hebrew, never לֹא.**  Thus, the use of the particle אַל with a cohortative does not reflect any specific nuance of meaning, as it does with certain imperfect and jussive forms.


The cohortative form can indicate any of the following kinds of actions:

#### 1) Indirect commands

> Deut 13:3 –  נֵֽלְכָ֞ה אַחֲרֵ֨י אֱלֹהִ֧ים אֲחֵרִ֛ים  "...***Let us go*** after other gods..."
 
#### 2) Actions of greater or lesser desirability (requests, invitations, wishes, etc.)

> Ruth 2:2 –  אֵֽלְכָה־נָּ֤א הַשָּׂדֶה֙  "...***Let me go*** to the field..."
> 
> Deut 12:20 –  וְאָמַרְתָּ֙ אֹכְלָ֣ה בָשָׂ֔ר  "...and you will say, '***I want to eat*** meat!'..."
> 
> Gen 45:28 –  אֵֽלְכָ֥ה וְאֶרְאֶ֖נּוּ בְּטֶ֥רֶם אָמֽוּת׃  "...***I will go*** and see him before I die."
>
