Noun Gentilic
=============

Summary
-------

A gentilic noun is a noun that describes the ethnic identity of a person or group of people.

Article
-------

Biblical Hebrew expresses national, tribal, or ancestral identity using nouns that (usually) immediately follow the noun they
describe.  For this reason, some scholars prefer to classify gentilic nouns as :ref:`gentilic adjectives<adjective_gentilic>`,
because they appear in the same position as :ref:`attributive adjectives<adjective-attributive>`.
Either classification is grammatically correct.
