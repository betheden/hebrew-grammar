Gender Feminine
===============

Summary
-------

Nouns, adjectives, finite verbs, participles, pronouns, pronominal suffixes, and some particles change their form is according to
their grammatical gender, either masculine or feminine. The feminine gender is often marked by either a ה- (qamets-he) or וֹת-
(holem-taw) suffix, but various other prefixes and suffixes can also indicate feminine gender.

Article

In Biblical Hebrew, :ref:`nouns<noun>`, :ref:`adjectives<adjective>`, participles (both active and passive),
are classified according to gender, either
:ref:`masculine<gender_masculine>`
or :ref:`feminine<gender-feminine>` or sometimes
:ref:`both<gender_both>`.
Adjectives, participles change endings when they refer to a
noun. This is because
:ref:`adjective`
agree with the gender of the noun they refer to. The gender of a :ref:`verb-finite-verbs`
agrees with its subject. All references to female persons in Biblical
Hebrew are grammatically feminine. However, other entities apart from people can also be classified as grammatically-feminine.
For example, the :ref:`proper names <noun_proper_name>` of cities are often feminine in Biblical Hebrew, as well as body parts
that exist as pairs (hand, foot, etc.).

Form
----

Feminine :ref:`singular<number_singular>` :ref:`nouns<noun>` and :ref:`adjectives<adjective>` usually end in either ה (qamets-he)
or ת (seghol-taw, for participles). Feminine :ref:`dual<number_dual>` terms end in ים (patach-yod-hireq-final mem), as in יָדַיִם (hands).
Feminine :ref:`plural<number_plural>` terms usually end in וֹת (holem-taw), as in תּוֹרוֹת (laws). There is a whole family of 
:ref:`verbal<verb>` prefixes and suffixes that indicate feminine gender for :ref:`finite<verb-finite>` verbs.

.. note:: Some feminine nouns do NOT take feminine endings, even some common
          nouns such as אֵם (mother) and אֶרֶץ (earth). They appear to be
          masculine nouns, but they are actually feminine nouns. A dictionary or
          lexicon will indicate the proper gender for each word.
