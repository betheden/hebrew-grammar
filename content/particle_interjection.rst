Particle Interjection
=====================

Summary
-------

An interjection is a word that expresses strong emotion.

Article
-------

Interjections usually appear at the beginning of a sentence or clause and are grammatically disconnectedfrom the rest of the
sentence. As in many other languages, interjections in Biblical Hebrew are most likely "natural sounds", i.e. vocal gestures or
sounds that a person utters when experiencing certain emotions. Interjections can be used to express both positive and negative
emotions; but in the Hebrew Bible, it is usually some kind of sadness. There is a whole family of interjections in Biblical
Hebrew, and none of them occur very frequently.
