Stem Niphal
===========

Summary
-------

The Niphal stem generally expresses passive or reflexive voice, but it
can also express other kinds of action depending on the context and the
specific verb.

Article
-------

The Niphal form is a verbal
:ref:`stem formation<stem>` in Biblical Hebrew, usually indicated by a נִ prefix before
the 1st radical of the
:ref:`verb<verb>`.
(This נ changes in multiple conjugations, see paradigms below.) The
Niphal stem is extremely flexible in its use in Biblical Hebrew.
Generally speaking, the Niphal stem expresses either :ref:`passive<stem-voice-passive>` or
:ref:`reflexive<stem-voice-reflexive>` voice; but it can also express :ref:`middle<stem-voice-middle>` voice,
:ref:`reciprocal<stem-voice-reciprocal>` voice, :ref:`simple<stem-action-simple>` action, or
even :ref:`stative<verb-stative>` action, depending on the context and the specific verb.
Some verbs express passive voice in the Niphal stem; some verbs express
reflexive voice in the Niphal stem; for some verbs, the Niphal stem
might express either passive voice or reflexive voice, depending on
the context; and so on.

Function
~~~~~~~~

The Niphal stem can express any of the following kinds of verbal action:

Expresses passive voice
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Passive voice means that the subject of the verb is *receiving* the
action rather than *performing* the action. In English, passive voice is
expressed using the helping verb "to be." In Biblical Hebrew, the
passive nature of the verbal action is expressed by the Niphal form of
the verb itself without any helping verbs.

.. csv-table:: Example: 2KI 21:18

  וַיִּקָּבֵ֥ר בְּגַן־בֵּית֖וֹ
  **wayyiqqaver** began-betho
  **and-he-was-buried** in-garden-of\_his-house
  **and he was buried** in the garden of his own house

Expresses reflexive voice
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Reflexive voice means that the subject of the verb is *both* performing
*and* receiving the action. In English, reflexive voice is expressed
using a reflexive pronoun as the object of the verb, "I tell *myself*".
In Biblical Hebrew, the reflexive nature of the verbal action is
expressed by the Niphal form of the verb itself without any additional
words.

.. csv-table:: Example: NUM 1:21

  הִבָּ֣דְל֔וּ מִתּ֖וֹךְ הָעֵדָ֣ה הַזֹּ֑את
  **hibbodlu** mittokh ha'edah hazzoth
  **Separate-yourselves** from-midst-of the-congregation the-this
  **Separate yourselves** from among this community

Expresses middle voice
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Middle voice means that the subject receives the action but also is
(partially) involved in performing the action. This kind of action
stands somewhere between passive voice and reflexive voice.

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 3:5

  וְנִפְקְח֖וּ עֵֽינֵיכֶ֑ם
  **wenifqehu** 'enekhem
  **and-they-will-be-opened** your-eyes
  your eyes **will be opened**

Expresses reciprocal voice
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Reciprocal voice means that multiple subjects are in view who are both
performing the action for another and receiving the action from another.
In English, reciprocal voice is expressed using the phrase "each other"
as the object of the verb, "They tell each other." In Biblical Hebrew,
the reciprocal nature of the action is expressed by the Niphal form of
the verb itself without any additional words.

Reciprocal voice must be distinguished from reflexive voice. The phrase
"They tell themselves" is reflexive: the subject "they" is a unified
group and the action could be expressed reflexively for each individual
as "he tells himself, and he tells himself, and she tells herself, etc."
The phrase "They tell each other" is reciprocal: each member of the
group is telling something to another member of the group, and each
member of the group is being told something by another member of the
group.

.. csv-table:: Example: 2KI 3:23

  נֶֽחֶרְבוּ֙ הַמְּלָכִ֔ים
  **nehervu** hammelakhim
  **they-have-killed-each-other** the-kings
  the kings **have killed each other**

Expresses :ref:`simple<stem-action-simple>` action
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In Biblical Hebrew, some verbs express different meanings in different
stem formations. A good example is the Hebrew verb רָאָה. In the Qal
stem, the verb רָאָה expresses the simple action "to seֶe". But in the
Niphal stem, the verb רָאָה expresses the simple action "to appear". A
dictionary or lexicon will indicate the different meanings for these
verbs in the various stem formations.

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 12:7

  וַיֵּרָ֤א יְהוָה֙ אֶל־אַבְרָ֔ם
  **wayyera** yehwah 'el-'avram
  **And-he-appeared** Yahweh to\_Abram
  Yahweh **appeared** to Abram

Expresses :ref:`stative<verb-stative>` action
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In Biblical Hebrew, some verbs express stative action in the *Niphal*
stem rather than the *Qal* stem. This is a very rare use of the Niphal
stem. Stative action is expressed most often using the Qal stem in
Biblical Hebrew.

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 6:6

  וַיִּנָּ֣חֶם יְהוָ֔ה כִּֽי־עָשָׂ֥ה אֶת־הָֽאָדָ֖ם בָּאָ֑רֶץ
  **wayyinnahem** yehwah ki-'asah 'eth-ha'adam ba'arets
  "**And-he-was-sorry** Yahweh that\_he-had-made [dir.obj]\_the-mankind
     on-the-earth"
  Yahweh **regretted** that he had made mankind on the earth
