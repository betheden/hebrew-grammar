In Biblical Hebrew, all nouns contain number, gender, state, and :ref:`definiteness<definiteness>`.
By number, a noun can be :ref:`singular<number_singular>`, :ref:`plural<number_plural>`, or :ref:`dual<number_dual>`.
By gender, a noun can be either can be :ref:`masculine<gender_masculine>` or :ref:`feminine<gender_feminine>`.
By state, a noun can be in the :ref:`construct state<state_construct>` or in the :ref:`absolute state<state_absolute>`.
Nouns are listed in a dictionary by their singular absolute form. Also, a variety of prefixes and/or
:ref:`suffixes<suffix>` can be attached to nouns that give extra information.

.. note:: Sometimes the actual classification of a noun does not match its form. For example, a noun can appear dual when it is actually plural; a noun can appear masculine when it is actually feminine; and so on.

In Biblical Hebrew, it is very common for words to change their function within a sentence.  For example, sometimes an adjective
:ref:`adjective-nominal`. Participles (both :ref:`active<participle_active>` and :ref:`passive<participle_passive>`) often function as nouns.  
Also, sometimes a noun can function as an :ref:`adverb<adverb>` or a :ref:`preposition<preposition>`.
