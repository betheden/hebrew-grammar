Preposition Definite Article
============================

Summary
-------

A preposition introduces a phrase that describes another word/concept within a sentence, usually a :ref:`noun<noun>` or a :ref:`verb<verb>`.
However, like :ref:`adverbs<adverb>` and :ref:`particles<particle>`, sometimes a prepositional phrase can describe the sentence as a whole.
In Biblical Hebrew, prepositions can also be used with an infinitive construct verb to show its relationship to the main verb of a sentence.

.. note:: When a word contains both a prefixed preposition and a :ref:`definite article<particle_definite_article>`, the ה consonant of the definite article disappears
and the shewa under the preposition lengthens, usually either to a pathah vowel or a qamets vowel.

Biblical Hebrew has four main prepositions: the prefix בְּ (in, at, by);
the prefix לְ (to, for); the prefix כְּ (as, like); and the prefix מִ
(which is a shortened form of the independent preposition מִן, meaning
"from"). However, there is also a family of other prepositions in
Biblical Hebrew. It is common in Biblical Hebrew for prepositions to be
combined together or with a noun to form new words that have their own
range of meanings (similar to :ref:`compound conjunctions<conjunction-compound>`)
that may or may not overlap with the meaning of the individual component
terms.

In Biblical Hebrew, prepositions also have a specialized function of
describing the relationship between a verbal complement (infinitive
construct or participles) and the main verb of a sentence. In some of
these instances, the preposition introduces a dependent verbal clauses
and thus changes its typical meaning. These specialized uses of
prepositions are listed in the article on :ref:`infinitive construct<infinitive_construct>` verbs.

.. note:: Of all the different kinds of words, prepositions are perhaps the
          most flexible in their meaning and are often translated in a variety of
          ways, or sometimes even left untranslated. For this reason, prepositions
          must always be translated with great sensitivity to the context of each
          use. A dictionary or lexicon will describe the various possible meanings
          of each preposition, but generally will not include a complete list of
          individual usages.

In Biblical Hebrew, there are 11 general types of prepositions: :ref:`indirect object<preposition-ind-obj>`;
:ref:`spatial<preposition-spatial>`; :ref:`locative<preposition-locative>`; :ref:`temporal<preposition-temporal>`;
:ref:`instrumental<preposition-instrumental>`; :ref:`correlative<preposition-correlative>`; :ref:`comparative<preposition-comparative>`; 
:ref:`directional<preposition-directional>`; :ref:`causal<preposition-causal>`; :ref:`explanatory<preposition-explanatory>`; 
and :ref:`direct object<preposition-dir-obj>`. However, this are also other types of prepositions in Biblical Hebrew.  
The specific meanings of individual prepositions can be found in a dictionary or lexicon.
