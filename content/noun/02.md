# noun Article

Add: Nouns are either [masculine](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/gender_masculine/02.md) or [feminine](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/gender_feminine/02.md), and the form of the noun often, but not always indicates which one it is.

Every noun also has a number ([singular](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/number_singular/02.md), [plural](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/number_plural/02.md), or [dual](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/number_dual/02.md)), and a state ([construct](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/state_construct/02.md) or [absolute](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/state_absolute/02.md)), the dictionary form is singular absolute. They can also take a variety of prefixes and [suffixes](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/suffix/02.md) that give extra information.

Sometimes an [adjective](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/adjective/02.md#substantive) or a [verb](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/verb/02.md#verbal-nouns) can function like a noun.

In Hebrew, nouns do not change their form based on the function (or case) they have in a sentence (subject/nominative, direct object/accusative, etc.).
