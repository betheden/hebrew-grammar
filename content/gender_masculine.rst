Gender Masculine
================

Nouns, adjectives, finite verbs, participles, pronouns, pronominal suffixes, and some particles change their form according to
grammatical gender, either masculine or feminine.  The masculine gender is usually indicated by the absence of any prefix or suffix.
However, various prefixes and suffixes can indicate masculine gender.

Article
-------

In Biblical Hebrew, :ref:`nouns<noun>` are classified according to gender, either masculine, :ref:`feminine<gender_feminine>`, or
sometimes :ref:`both<gender_both>`. Grammatical modifiers (such as :ref:`adjectives<adjective>`, :ref:`active<participle_active>`
and :ref:`passive<participle_passive>` participles, :ref:`pronouns<pronoun>`, :ref:`pronominal suffixes<suffix_pronominal>`)
change their endings in order to agree with the gender of the term they refer to. A :ref:`finite verb<verb-finite>`
with masculine gender indicates a masculine subject. All references to male persons in Biblical Hebrew are masculine.
However, other entities apart from people can also be classified as maculine. For example, the :ref:`proper names <noun_proper_name>`
of nations and tribes are often masculine in Biblical Hebrew. Some :ref:`particles<particle>` are also marked for gender
in Biblical Hebrew.

.. note:: Some nouns appear to be masculine but are actually feminine, even some common
          nouns such as אֵם (mother) and אֶרֶץ (earth). These nouns are feminine even though they do NOT take feminine
          endings. A dictionary orlexicon will indicate the proper gender for each word.

Form
----

Masculine :ref:`singular<number_singular>` :ref:`nouns<noun>` and :ref:`adjectives<adjective>` have no unique ending;
they are the standard dictionary form. Masculine :ref:`dual<number_dual>` terms end in ־ַיִם (pataq-yod-hireq-final mem),
as in אַפַּיִם (nostrils). Masculine :ref:`plural<number_plural>` terms usually end in ־ִים (hireq-yod-final mem),
as in אֲנָשִׁים (men). There is a whole family of :ref:`verbal<verb>` prefixes and suffixes that indicate feminine gender for :ref:`finite<verb-finite>` verbs.

Paradigm
~~~~~~~~

Besides nouns, a masculine word can be recognized by a variety of
changes to the form. These changes differ greatly from each other and
are hard to sum up in a simple, helpful way. This paradigm shows a
sample of the kinds of changes that signal a masculine form.
