# state_absolute Article

## Form
A [noun](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/noun/02.md) (or [adjective](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/adjective/02.md)) in the absolute state has the standard dictionary form in the [singular](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/number_singular/02.md), or the standard [plural](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/number_plural/02.md) form.
It can have a [definite article](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/preposition_definite_article/02.md) as a prefix, but it has no [suffixes](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/suffix/02.md).

## Function
The absolute state is the normal form of the noun, or adjective, and it will always be in the absolute state unless something in the context forces it to become a [construct state](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/state_construct/02.md).
The absolute state means that the word is independent and can stand on its own, while a construct word cannot.

### By itself
If a noun occurs "by itself" as the only word of a subject or object, it is in the absolute state.

* GEN 1:1
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>בָּרָ֣א אֱלֹהִ֑ים אֵ֥ת הַשָּׁמַ֖יִם וְאֵ֥ת הָאָֽרֶץ׃</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>**[Insert Transliteration]**</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>he created God the heavens and the earth.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>God created the heavens and the earth.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
Both "God", the subject, and "the heavens" and "the earth", the two direct objects, are in the absolute state.

### With a word in the [construct state](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/state_construct/02.md).
If connected with a word in the construct state, the absolute state is always at the end of the chain.

#### Indefinite

* EXO 15:3
<table border="1" class="docutils">

<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>אִ֣ישׁ מִלְחָמָ֑ה</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>**[Insert Transliteration]**</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>a man of war</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>a warrior</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
"man" is in the construct state, and "war" is in the absolute state.
