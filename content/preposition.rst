Preposition
===========

Summary
-------

A preposition introduces a phrase that describes another word/concept within a sentence, usually a :ref:`noun<noun>` or a :ref:`verb<verb>`.
However, like :ref:`adverbs<adverb>` and :ref:`particles<particle>`, sometimes a prepositional phrase can describe the sentence as a whole.
In Biblical Hebrew, prepositions can also be used with an infinitive construct verb to show its relationship to the main verb of a sentence.

Article
-------

Biblical Hebrew has four main prepositions: the prefix בְּ (in, at, by);
the prefix לְ (to, for); the prefix כְּ (as, like); and the prefix מִ
(which is a shortened form of the independent preposition מִן, meaning
"from"). However, there is also a family of other prepositions in
Biblical Hebrew. It is common in Biblical Hebrew for prepositions to be
combined together or with a noun to form new words that have their own
range of meanings (similar to :ref:`compound conjunctions<conjunction-compound>`)
that may or may not overlap with the meaning of the individual component terms.

In Biblical Hebrew, prepositions also function to describe the relationship between a
:ref:`non-finite<verb-non-finite>` verbal complement (:ref:`infinitive construct<infinitive_construct>` verbs
and :ref:`active<participle_active>` or :ref:`passive<participle_passive>` participles) and the :ref:`finite<verb-finite>` 
main verb of a sentence. In some of these instances, the preposition introduces a dependent verbal phrase
and thus changes its typical meaning. These specialized uses of prepositions are listed in the article
on :ref:`infinitive construct<infinitive_construct>` verbs.

.. note:: Of all the different kinds of words, prepositions are perhaps the
          most flexible in their meaning and are often translated in a variety of
          ways, or sometimes even left untranslated. For this reason, prepositions
          must always be translated with great sensitivity to the context of each
          use. A dictionary or lexicon will describe the various possible meanings
          of each preposition, but generally will not include a complete list of
          individual usages.

Types
-----

In Biblical Hebrew, there are 11 general types of prepositions: spatial; temporal; locative; directional; instrumental;
causal; explanatory; correlative (the primary use of כְּ); comparative (a common use of מִן);
indirect object (a common use of לְ); and direct object (a rare use of לְ). 
However, this are also other types of prepositions in Biblical Hebrew.

Indirect Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A common use of the preposition לְ is to indicate the indirect object of the verb.  
When used in this way, the preposition is usually transated into English with "to", or it can be left untranslated.
