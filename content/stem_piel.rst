Stem Piel
=========

Summary
-------

The Piel stem is the most flexible stem formation in Biblical Hebrew and
can express simple, intensive, resultative, causative, or other kinds of
verbal action depending on the context and the specific verb.

Article
-------

The Piel form is a verbal
:ref:`stem`
formation in Biblical Hebrew, usually indicated by a daghesh in the 2nd
radical of the
:ref:`verb`.
The Piel stem is the most flexible in its use of all the various stem
formations; it can express simple action, intensive action, resultative
action, causative action, or other kinds of action (all in active voice)
depending on the context and the specific verb. Some verbs express
simple action in the Piel stem; some verbs express intensive action in
the Piel stem; for some verbs, the Piel stem might express either simple
action or intensive action, depending on the context; and so on.

Function
--------

The Piel stem can express any of the following kinds of verbal action:

Expresses simple action
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Biblical Hebrew, some verbs can express *different* meanings in
*different* stem formations. A good example is the Hebrew verb נָחַם. In
the :ref:`stem_niphal`,
the verb נָחַם usually expresses either stative action ("to be sorry")
or passive action ("to be comforted"). But in the Piel stem, the verb
נָחַם expresses the simple action "to comfort". A dictionary or lexicon
will indicate the different meanings for these verbs in the various stem
formations.

-  RUT 2:13

.. csv-table::

  כִּ֣י נִֽחַמְתָּ֔נִי
  ki **nihamtani**
  for **you-have-comforted-me**
  for **you have comforted me**

On the other hand, some verbs express the *same* meaning in *multiple*
stem formations. A good example is the verb אָסַף, which expresses the
simple action "to gather" in both the :ref:`stem_qal`
and the Piel stem. This also will be indicated by a dictionary or
lexicon.

-  JDG 19:18

.. csv-table::

  וְאֵ֣ין אִ֔ישׁ **מְאַסֵּ֥ף** אוֹתִ֖י הַבָּֽיְתָה
  we'en 'ish **me'assef** 'othi habbayethah
  and-there-is-not man **gathering** [dir.obj]-me to-the-house
  but there is no one **who will take me** into his house

Expresses resultative action
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Resultative action means that the primary focus of the verb is on the
result of the verbal action. A good example is the verb שָׁלַח. In the
Qal stem, the verb שָׁלַח means "to send" or "to stretch out". But in the
Piel stem, the verb שָׁלַח means "to send away".

-  GEN 21:6

.. csv-table::

  וַיִּתֵּ֣ן ... וְאֶת־הַיֶּ֖לֶד וַֽיְשַׁלְּחֶ֑הָ
  wayyitten ... we'eth-hayyeled **wayeshalleheha**
  and-he-gave ... and-[dir.obj]\_the-boy **and-he-sent-her-away**
  He gave her the boy and **sent her away**

Expresses causative action
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Causative action means that the subject of the verb is causing the
object of the verb either to perform the verbal action (:ref:`verb-dynamic-or-action-verbs`)
or to be in the state described by the verb (:ref:`verb-stative-or-non-action-verbs`).
The Piel stem often serves this causative function with stative verbs. A
good example is the verb מָלֵא. In the Qal stem, the verb מָלֵא
expresses the stative action "to be full". But in the Piel stem, the
verb מָלֵא expresses the causative action "to fill" (meaning, *to cause
something to be full*). In English, causative action is expressed using
the main verb "to cause" paired with the infinitive of the verbal action
in view. In Biblical Hebrew, the causative nature of the verbal action
is expressed by the Piel form of the verb itself with no additional
verbal element.

.. note:: Causative action must be expressed by a :ref:`verb-transitive-verbs`,
          but non-causative action can be expressed by an :ref:`verb-intransitive-verbs`.
          Thus, a verb that is transitive in the Piel stem may be intransitive in
          the Qal and/or Niphal stems.

-  JOB 38:12 –– expressing causative action with a dynamic verb

.. csv-table::

  הְֽ֭מִיָּמֶיךָ צִוִּ֣יתָ בֹּ֑קֶר **יִדַּ֖עְתָּ** שַׁחַר מְקֹמֽוֹ
  hemiyyameykha tsiwwitha boqer **yidda'ta** shahar meqomo
  "[quest.]-from-your-days you-commanded morning **you-make-known** dawn
     his-place"
  "Have you ever, since your own days began, given orders to the morning
     to begin, and **caused** the morning dawn **to know** its place"

-  GEN 21:19 –– expressing causative action with a stative verb

.. csv-table::

  וַתֵּ֜לֶךְ **וַתְּמַלֵּ֤א** אֶת־הַחֵ֙מֶת֙ מַ֔יִם
  wattelekh **wattemalle** 'eth-hahemeth mayim
  and-she-went **and-she-filled** [dir.obj]\_the-skin-of water
  She went **and filled** the skin with water

Expresses intensive action
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Intensive action means that the verbal action is strengthened in some
way. A good example is the Hebrew verb שָׁבַר. In the Qal stem, the verb
שָׁבַר means "to break". But in the Piel stem, the verb שָׁבַר means "to
shatter" or "to break in pieces". A dictionary or lexicon will indicate
an intensive nuance in comparison with the meaning of the verb in other
stem formations.

-  EXO 9:25

.. csv-table::

  אֶת־מִזְבְּחֹתָם֙ תִּתֹּצ֔וּן וְאֶת־מַצֵּבֹתָ֖ם תְּשַׁבֵּר֑וּן
  'eth-mizbehotham tittotsun we'eth-matsevotham **teshabberun**
  "[dir.obj]\_their-altars you-break-down and-[dir.obj]\_their-pillars
     **you-shatter**"
  "you must break down their altars, **smash** their stone pillars"

Expresses various other kinds of verbal action
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes the Piel form is used in ways that do not follow the general
conventions of the Piel stem as listed above. In these instances, the
context demonstrates that none of the normal meanings of the verbal
action make sense. A dictionary or lexicon will indicate the correct
meaning in these rare instances of the Piel stem.

-  ISA 10:1 –– the Piel form of the verb כָּתַב ("to write") has
   uncertain meaning, but seems to indicate *a specific kind* of writing

.. csv-table::

  "ה֥וֹי הַחֹֽקְקִ֖ים חִקְקֵי־אָ֑וֶן **וּֽמְכַתְּבִ֥ים** עָמָ֖ל
     **כִּתֵּֽבוּ**\ ׃"
  hoy hahoqeqim hiqqe-'awen **umekhattevim** 'amal **kittevu**
  "woe the-ones-who-enact laws-of\_iniquity **and-writers** oppression
     **they-write**"
  Woe to those who enact unjust laws **and write** unfair **decrees**

-  NUM 19:19 –– the verb חָטָא means "to sin" in the Qal stem, but ִin
   the Piel stem it means "to purify"

.. csv-table::

  וְחִטְּאוֹ֙ בַּיּ֣וֹם הַשְּׁבִיעִ֔י
  **wehitte'o** bayyom hashevi'i
  **and-he-purifies-him** on-the-day the-seventh
  On the seventh day the unclean person **must purify himself**

-  JOB 1:5 –– verbal action is the *opposite* of the normal meaning of
   the verb

.. csv-table::

  אוּלַי֙ חָטְא֣וּ בָנַ֔י **וּבֵרֲכ֥וּ** אֱלֹהִ֖ים בִּלְבָבָ֑ם
  'ulay hot'u vanay **uverakhu** 'elohim bilvavam
  "perhaps they-have-sinned my-sons **and-they-have-blessed** God
     in-their-hearts"
  Perhaps my children have sinned **and cursed** God in their hearts
