State Absolute
==============

Summary
-------

The absolute state is the standard form of a word (noun, adjective, participle, or infinitive) in contrast to a modified form
called the construct state.  The absolute state is used when a word neither takes a suffix nor is connected to a subsequent word
by a construct relationship.

Article
-------

Nouns, adjectives, participles and infinitives can appear in either the absolute state or the construct state.  The absolute
state is the standard form and consists of the longer ending as opposed to the shorter construct ending.  The most fundamental
difference between the two forms is that the construct form can take an attached suffix, but the absolute form cannot.
Nouns, adjectives and participles can appear in either the absolute or the construct state for both masculine and feminine terms
in both singular and plural forms. Because infinitives do not change form for either gender or number, there is only one
infinitive construct form and one infinitive absolute form for any given verb in Biblical Hebrew.  It should be noted
both the infinitive construct and infinitive absolute can have variant spellings or forms.  However, these variations are due to
other linguistic factors, not because of changes to the form based on gender or number.

Note: The absolute state and construct state forms of many masculine singular nouns appear exactly alike.

Examples
--------

The absolute state is the normal form of the noun, or adjective, and it
will always be in the absolute state unless something in the context
forces it to become a :ref:`state_construct`.
The absolute state means that the word is independent and can stand on
its own, while a construct word cannot. See also: :ref:`infinitive_absolute`.

Standing alone
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Biblical Hebrew, when a term stands alone and is not grammatically connected to any other word, it appears in the absolute
state.    

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 1:1

  בָּרָ֣א **אֱלֹהִ֑ים** אֵ֥ת **הַשָּׁמַ֖יִם** וְאֵ֥ת **הָאָֽרֶץ**\ ׃
  bara **'elohim** 'eth **hashamayim** we'eth **ha'arets**
  "he-created **God** [dir.obj] **the-heavens** and-[dir.obj]
     **the-earth**."
  **God** created **the heavens** and **the earth**.

   Both "God", the subject, and "the heavens" and "the earth", the two
   direct objects, are in the absolute state.


Concluding term of a :ref:`construct chain<state_construct>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a word in the absolute state is connected with a word in the
construct state, it forms a so-called construct chain, in which case the
word in the absolute state is always at the end of the chain.

Indefinite construct chains
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If all nouns form a construct chain and both are indefinite you can
sometimes translate with an indefinite article.

.. csv-table:: Example: 2SA 17:25

  וַעֲמָשָׂ֣א **בֶן**\ ־אִ֗ישׁ וּשְׁמֹו֙ יִתְרָ֣א
  wa'amasa **ven**-'ish ushemow yithra
  and-Amasa **son-of**\ \_man and-his-name Jether
  Amasa was **a son of** a man named Jether

.. csv-table:: Example: EXO 15:3

  אִ֣ישׁ מִלְחָמָ֑ה
  'ish **milhamah**
  man-of **war**
  a **warr**\ ior

   In this example "a man of war" is an idiomatic expression, so the
   smooth translation reads "a warrior".

Definite construct chains
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the final, absolute, noun in a constuct chain is definite, the whole
chain is definite.

.. csv-table:: Example: 2SA 14:26

  בְּאֶ֥בֶן **הַמֶּֽלֶךְ**\ ׃
  be'even **hammelekh**
  in-weight-of **the-king**.
  by the weight of **the king**'s standard.

"weight" is in the construct state, and "the king" is both definite and
absolute. Because the absolute noun is definite, the construct noun is
also definite.

Genitive relationships
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
