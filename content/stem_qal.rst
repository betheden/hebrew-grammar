Stem Qal
========

Summary
-------

The Qal stem is the stem formation that is the simplest of form in
Biblical Hebrew. The Qal stem is generally used to express either simple
action or stative action.

Article
-------

In Biblical Hebrew, the Qal stem is the simplest of all the verbal
:ref:`stem formations<stem>` in both form and function. All the other stem formations are
derived from the Qal form. It is by far the most common form of a
:ref:`verb<verb>`,
and it almost always expresses either simple action in :ref:`active<stem-voice-active>` voice (for
:ref:`dynamic<verb-dynamic>` verbs) or stative action in :ref:`passive<stem-voice-passive>` voice (for :ref:`stative<verb-stative>` verbs,
which do not have active voice). In English, stative verbs require the
helping verb "to be" for proper translation value (see example). In
Biblical Hebrew, the stative nature of the verb is indicated by the verb
itself without requiring any additional helping verbs.

Form

Paradigm
~~~~~~~~

Depending on the verb form, there are often two or three different ways
of conjugating a verb in the Qal stem. Which way is used depends on
which verb it is.
