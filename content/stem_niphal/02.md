# stem_niphal Article
The Niphal stem is a verbal [stem](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem/02.md) formation in Biblical Hebrew, indicated by a נ prefix (with shewa) to the [verb](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/verb/02.md). The Niphal stem is extremely flexible in its use in Biblical Hebrew.  Generally speaking, the Niphal stem expresses passive action; but it can also express reflexive, reciprocal, repetitive, stative, or even simple action, depending on the context and the specific verb.  Some verbs express passive action in the Niphal stem; some verbs express reflexive action in the Niphal stem; for some verbs, the Niphal stem might express either passive action or reflexive action, depending on the context; and so on.

NOTE: It is recommended to *always* consult a dictionary or lexicon for the specific meaning of the Niphal stem for any verb, because the Niphal stem expresses different kinds of action for various verbs.

### Form

**[paradigm]**

### Function

The Niphal stem can express any of the following kinds of verbal action:

#### Expresses passive action
Passive action means that the subject of the verb is *receiving* the action rather than *performing* the action. In English, passive action is expressed using the helping verb "to be."  In Biblical Hebrew, the passive nature of the verbal action is expressed by the Niphal form of the verb itself without any helping verbs.

</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>**and he was buried** in the garden of his house</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>**and he was buried** in the garden of his own house</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

#### Expresses reflexive action
Reflexive action means that the subject of the verb is *both* performing *and* receiving the action. In English, reflexive action is expressed using a reflexive pronoun as the object of the verb, "I tell *myself*".  In Biblical Hebrew, the reflexive nature of the verbal action is expressed by the Niphal form of the verb itself without any additional words.

</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>I will take vengeance against my adversaries, and avenge myself against my enemies</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

#### Expresses middle action
Middle action means that the subject receives the action but also is (partially) involved in performing the action.  This kind of action stands somewhere between passive action and reflexive action.

</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>and will be opened your eyes</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>your eyes will be opened</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

#### Expresses reciprocal action
Reciprocal action means that multiple subjects are in view who are both performing the action for another and receiving the action from another.  In English, reciprocal action is expressed using the phrase "each other" as the object of the verb, "They tell each other."  In Biblical Hebrew, the reciprocal nature of the action is expressed by the Niphal form of the verb itself without any additional words.  

Reciprocal action must be distinguished from reflexive action.  The phrase "They tell themselves" is reflexive: the subject "they" is a unified group and the action could be expressed reflexively for each individual as "he tells himself, and he tells himself, and she tells herself, etc."  The phrase "They tell each other" is reciprocal: each member of the group is telling something to another member of the group, and each member of the group is being told something by another member of the group.

<tr class="row-odd"><td>they have killed each other the kings</td>

<tr class="row-even"><td>the kings have killed each other</td>
</tr>

#### Expresses simple action
In Biblical Hebrew, some verbs express different meanings in different stem formations.  A good example is the Hebrew verb רָאָה.  In the Qal stem, the verb רָאָה expresses the simple action "to seֶe".  But in the Niphal stem, the verb רָאָה expresses the simple action "to appear".  A dictionary or lexicon will indicate the different meanings for these verbs in the various stem formations.

</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>**And he appeared** Yahweh to Abram</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Yahweh **appeared** to Abram,...</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

#### Expresses repetitive action
Repetitive action means to repeat an action that has been done already in the past. In English, repetitive action is expressed using the prefix "re-", as in to *rebuild*, to *replant*, etc. In Biblical Hebrew, the repetitive nature of the action is expressed by the Niphal form of the verb itself without any additional grammatical element.

<tr class="row-odd"><td>**And he appeared** Yahweh to Abram</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Yahweh **appeared** to Abram,...</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

#### Expresses stative action

In Biblical Hebrew, some verbs express stative action in the *Niphal* stem rather than the *Qal* stem. This is a very rare use of the Niphal stem. Stative action is expressed most often using the Qal stem in Biblical Hebrew.
