# particle Article
Particles are auxiliary words in a language that do not describe or refer to an object or an action. Rather, they either describe how the other words in a sentence relate to each other, or emphasize a particular word or aspect of meaning within a sentence. Some Hebrew particles are prefixes that are attached to another word.

NOTE: The classification of these words (i.e. words called "particles" in this grammar) is a subject of much debate among Hebrew linguists.  This is true even for particles which have a clear meaning and function. Other parsing systems may have different names for these groups of particles, may have different groupings, or may even parse an individual particle as another kind of word such as a [noun](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/noun/02.md), an [adverb](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/adverb/02.md), a [conjunction](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/conjunction/02.md), or others. 

## Types
The parsing system used by this grammar identifies the following types of particles:

### [Affirmation](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/particle_affirmation/02.md)	
These particles usually convey a sense of "affirmation of" or "addition to" some idea within the sentence.  In English, they are commonly translated using words such as "yes" or "also" or "even" or "really", etc.
 
### [Definite article](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/particle_definite_article/02.md)
This is a prefix that will make a word [definite](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/state_determined/02.md) (or determined).
 
### [Demonstrative](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/particle_demonstrative/02.md)	
These particles focus the attention of the reader or listener to the word, phrase, or sentence that immediately follows. In English, they are commonly translated using words such as "See!" or "Look!" or "Behold!", etc.

### [Direct object marker](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/particle_direct_object_marker/02.md)
This particle precedes the direct object in a sentence, especially if there is a possible confusion.

### [Exhortation](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/particle_exhortation/02.md)	
Exhortation particles are used to emphasize or strengthen a request or command. They are often left untranslated in English.

### [Interjection](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/particle_interjection/02.md)	
Interjections are involuntary exclamations of pure emotion.

### [Interrogative](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/particle_interrogative/02.md)	
This prefix is used to indicate that what follows is a question.

### [Negative](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/particle_negative/02.md)	
These particles are used to negate a [noun](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/noun/02.md) or [verb](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/verb/02.md).

### [Relative](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/particle_relative/02.md)
These particles introduce a relative clause or phrase, often more fully describing a preceding noun.
