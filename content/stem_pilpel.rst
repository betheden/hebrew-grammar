Stem Pilpel
===========

Summary
-------

The Pilpel is a rare stem formation that is similar to the Piel and
expresses the same range of meanings.

Article
-------

The Pilpel stem is a variation of the :ref:`stem_piel`
and has potential to express the same range of verbal action. The Pilpel
stem is formed from the Piel by dropping the 2nd radical and repeating
the 1st and 3rd radical, thus making a verb that appears to have 4
consonants. It is a rare verbal form in Biblical Hebrew. Many of the
occurrences of the Pilpel stem in the Hebrew Bible are from the root
verb כּוּל ("to comprehend, contain").
