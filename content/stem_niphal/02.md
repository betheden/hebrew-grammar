# stem_niphal Article
The Niphal is one of the Hebrew verb stems. It is often recognized by a נ and a shewa before the verb and usually makes the verb passive but can also be adjectival or have reflexive, reciprocal, middle, or denominative meaning.
When using a dictionary, it is recommended to look for the specific meaning of the niphal stem for this verb. Sometimes it is easy to guess the nuance the niphal adds to the verb, but sometimes it is harder to predict.

## Passive
Passive means that the verb does not emphasize what the subject does, but what happens to the object. So instead of "people buried him" (active), English and Hebrew can make that phrase passive "he was buried (by people)".

* EXO 12:16

	* כָּל־מְלָאכָה֙ לֹא־יֵעָשֶׂ֣ה
	
	* kol-mĕlāʾkāh lōʾ-yēʿāśe
	
	* All work not will be done

	* No work will be done

* 2KI 21:18

    * וַיִּקָּבֵ֥ר בְּגַן־בֵּית֖וֹ
	
	* wayyiqqābēr bĕgan-bêtô
	
	* and he was buried in the garden of his house

    * and he was buried in the garden of his own house

## Reflexive
A reflexive verb means that the verb is done by the subject, and to or on behalf of the subject and making the subject also the object or the indirect object.
"I wash the dog" I is the subject, the dog is the direct object, but "I wash myself" I is both subject and direct object.
"I will avenge Israel" I is the subject, Israel is the indirect object since "I" is doing something for Israel, but "I avenge myself" makes I both subject and indirect object.

* ISA 1:24

	* אֶנָּחֵ֣ם מִצָּרַ֔י וְאִנָּקְמָ֖ה מֵאוֹיְבָֽי׃
	
	* ʾennāḥēm miṣṣāray wĕʾinnoqmâ mēʾôyĕbāy
	
	* I will take vengance on my adversaries, and I will avenge myself on my enemies

	* I will take vengeance against my adversaries, and avenge myself against my enemies;

## Reciprocal
A verb has a reciprocal meaning when the subject is plural and the two or more parts of the subject do the action to each other. This is similar to reflexive, but distinguishes more between the individuals.
"They wash themselves" is reflexive and sees "they" as a unified group and could be broken up for each individual as "he washes himself, and he washes himself, and she washes herself, etc."
"They wash each other" is reciprocal and implies that if you isolate the actions of one individual, he does not wash himself, but washes someone else in the group.

* EXO 21:22

	* ווְכִֽי־יִנָּצ֣וּ אֲנָשִׁ֗ים
	
	* wwky-ynṣ ʾănāšîm
	
	* And when fight men

	* If men fight together

* 2KI 3:23

	* נֶֽחֶרְבוּ֙ הַמְּלָכִ֔ים
	
	* neḥerbû hammĕlākîm
	
	* they have killed each other the kings
	
	* the kings have killed each other

## Adjectival
The verb functions like an adjective.

* LEV 11:34

	* מִכָּל־הָאֹ֜כֶל אֲשֶׁ֣ר יֵאָכֵ֗ל
	
	* mikkol-hāʾōkel ʾăšer yēʾākēl
	
	* Of all the food that is edible

	* All the food that is permitted to be eaten

## Middle
When in English a verb is passive, but the object that receives the action is also (partially) involved in the action taking place.

* GEN 3:5

	* וְנִפְקְח֖וּ עֵֽינֵיכֶ֑ם
	
	* wĕnipqĕḥû ʿênêkem
	
	* and will be opened your eyes
	
	* your eyes will be opened
	
* JOB 26:8

	* וְלֹא־נִבְקַ֖ע עָנָ֣ן
	
	* wĕlōʾ-nibqaʿ ʿānān
	
	* and they are not torn clouds
	
	* but the clouds are not torn
	
* EZK 1:1

	* נִפְתְּחוּ֙ הַשָּׁמַ֔יִם
	
	* niptĕḥû haššāmayim
	
	* Were opened the heavens
	
	* The heavens were opened

## Denominative
When a noun is turned into a verb.

* GEN 16:2

	* אוּלַ֥י אִבָּנֶ֖ה מִמֶּ֑נָּה
	
	* ʾûlay ʾibbāne mimmennâ
	
	* Perhaps I will build by her.

	* It may be that I will have children by her.

The verb "build"/"have children" comes from the noun for "son/child".
