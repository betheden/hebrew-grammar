Stem Hithpolel
==============

Summary
-------

The Hithpolel is a rare stem formation that is similar to the Hithpael.
It expresses the reflexive voice of the Polel stem.

Article
-------

The Hithpolel stem is a variation of the :ref:`stem_hithpael`
and expresses the reflexive voice of the verbal action of the :ref:`stem_polel`.
The Hithpolel stem is formed from the Hithpael by dropping the 2nd
radical and repeating the 3rd radical (with a vowel change). It is a
rare verbal form in Biblical Hebrew. It is recommended to *always*
consult a dictionary or lexicon for the precise nuance of any verb in
the Nithpael stem.

.. note:: The Hithpolel stem conjugates exactly like the Polel stem, but
          with the reflexive prefix (הִתְ) added.
