State Construct
===============

Summary
-------

The contruct state is a modified form of a word (noun, adjective, participle, or infinitive) in contrast to the standard form
called the absolute state.  The construct state is used when a word takes a suffix or is connected to another term in a
construct chain.

Article
-------

:ref:`Nouns<noun>`, :ref:`adjectives<adjective>`, :ref:`participles<participle_active>` and
:ref:`infinitives<infinitive_construct>` can appear in either the :ref:`absolute state<state_absolute>` or the construct state.
The construct state ending is shorter than the absolute state ending and can take an attached :ref:`suffix<suffix>`.
Nouns, adjectives and participles can appear in either the absolute state or the construct state for both 
:ref:`masculine<gender_masculine>` and :ref:`feminine<gender_feminine>` terms in both :ref:`singular<number_singular>`
and :ref:`plural<number_plural>` forms. Because infinitives do not change form for either gender or number, there is
usually only one :ref:`infinitive construct<infinitive_construct>` form and one :ref:`infinitive absolute<infinitive_absolute>`
form of a verb in Biblical Hebrew.

Note: Many masculine singular nouns appear exactly alike in both the absolute state and the construct state. 

The construct state serves a unique function in Biblical Hebrew to grammatically link a word to the following word(s),making
a single grammatical unit called a :ref:`construct chain<state_construct-construct-chain>`. Words in a construct chain are often
translated into English with the word "of" between them.  Construct chains can consist of two words (for example, "the *king* of
*Israel*") or more than two words (for example, "the *son* of the *king* of *Israel*").  

Form
----

For most nouns, the masculine singular form is identical to the absolute state. The masculine plural construct ending drops the
final ם and changes the final hireq to a segol (i-sound to e-sound).

Usually, the feminine singular construct ending changes from a final ה to a final ת.  The feminine plural construct ending is
identical to the absolute state.

Forming a construct chain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Two or more terms that are gramatically linked together to form a construct chain can express a wide range of meanings.
The initial term(s) in a construct chain always appears in the construct state and is called the "construct noun(s)."
The final term in a construct chain always appears in the absolute state and is called the
:ref:`"absolute noun"<state_absolute-absolute-noun>`.  The absolute noun always determines whether a construct chain is
:ref:`definite<state_absolute-definite-chain>` or :ref:`indefinite<state_absolute-indefinite-chain>`.  

Possessive

A construct noun can indicate a person/thing possessed by the absolute noun.
