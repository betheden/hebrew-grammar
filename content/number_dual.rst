Article

:ref:`Nouns<noun>` change their form is according to their number, either :ref:`singular<number_singular>`,
dual, or :ref:`plural<number_plural>`. The dual ending does not only mean "two" but usually refers to a pair of something,
such as עֵינַ֥יִם (two eyes) or אָזְנַ֣יִם (two ears).  However, sometimes the dual ending is used for a singular noun, such as 
the noun פַּנַיִם which takes a dual ending but is translated into English as the singular noun "face".

.. note:: Dual nouns always take :ref:`adjectives<adjective>` with a :ref:`plural<number_plural>` ending, not a dual ending.

Form
----

Both :ref:`masculine<gender_masculine>` and :ref:`feminine<gender_feminine>` terms take the same ending,
־ַיִם (pathah-yod-hireq-final mem).
