# adjective_cardinal_number Article

Hebrew has two sets of numbers: cardinal and ordinal. 

## One
### Attributive
The Hebrew “one” is usually an attributive adjective. This means if it follows its noun, it matches its gender and definiteness. 

* JDG 18:19

    * אִ֣ישׁ אֶחָ֔ד	

    * one man

Sometimes it has no article, even though its noun has one.

* 1SA 13:17 

    * הָרֹ֨אשׁ אֶחָ֥ד

    * the one band

### Substantive

“One” can also be substantive. This means it acts like a noun when there is no noun.

## Two

The Hebrew “two” is substantive. It matches the gender of its noun. It will precede a noun if the number is in construct. 

* 1CH 4:5

    * שְׁתֵּ֣י נָשִׁ֑ים 	

    * two women

In construct it can have a suffixed pronoun

* GEN 3:7

    * שְׁנֵיהֶ֔ם

    * two of them

Otherwise, it can be in the absolute form in apposition to its noun. 


## Three through ten

Three through ten use the opposite gender of their noun. (For example, feminine nouns use a masculine form of the number.) 

They also appear to be singular even though their nouns are plural. 

They will precede a noun if the number is in construct. Otherwise, they can be in the absolute form in apposition to their noun. These also usually precede the noun.

* JOB 1:2

    * שִׁבְעָ֥ה בָנִ֖ים וְשָׁל֥וֹשׁ בָּנֽוֹת
    
    * seven sons and three daughters”

Exceptions: In Gen 7:13, 1 Sam 10:3, and Job 1:4 the numbers match the gender of their nouns, and thus do not follow the rule about gender.


## 11-19 and multiples of ten 

11-19 and multiples of ten usually precede the noun and are in apposition. If the number precedes the noun, the noun is plural except for common nouns such as יום ,נפש ,איש .

The word for “ten” matches the gender of the noun, but the word for the digit is the opposite gender. 

* 2SA 9:10

    * חֲמִשָּׁ֥ה עָשָׂ֛ר בָּנִ֖ים

    * fifteen sons (literally, five (feminine) ten (masculine) sons (masculine))

To show definiteness, the article may be prefixed to either the number or the noun.  

* JOS 4:4 

    * שְׁנֵ֤ים הֶֽעָשָׂר֙

    * the twelve men


## Multiples of ten plus units

Multiples of ten plus units follow plural nouns or precede singular nouns.

* GEN 5:20
    
    * שְׁתַּ֤יִם וְשִׁשִּׁים֙ שָׁנָ֔ה

    * sixty (plural) and two (plural) year (singular)

* DAN 9:26

    * וְאַחֲרֵ֤י הַשָּׁבֻעִים֙ שִׁשִּׁ֣ים וּשְׁנַ֔יִם

    * and after the weeks (plural) sixty (plural) and two (plural)

To show definiteness, the article may be prefixed to either the number or the noun.
