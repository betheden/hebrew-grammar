Pronoun Demonstrative
=====================

Summary
-------

Demonstrative pronouns specifically refer to a person or thing that is presumed familiar to the reader or listener.
Demonstrative pronouns are usually translated into English with the words "this", "that", "these", or "those".

Article
-------

A demonstrative :ref:`pronoun` refers to a :ref:`noun` or phrase that is presumed familiar to the reader or listener. For
example if it has been mentioned earlier in the sentence. It can also
function as a demonstrative
:ref:`adjective`,
in which case it commonly follows the noun, even if in English it always
precedes the noun.

Demonstrative pronouns are also one of the types of words that are
:ref:`state_determined-demonstrative-pronouns`,
even if they can additionally have a :ref:`particle_definite_article`.

Form
----

Biblical Henrew contains four common demonstrative pronouns that have separate endings for :ref:`singular<number_singular>`
and :ref:`plural<number_plural>`, as well as :ref:`masculine<gender_masculine>` and :ref:`feminine<gender_feminine>`.
Demonstrative pronouns in Biblical Hebrew do not have separate forms for first, second, or third person.

Note, the "far" forms are identical to the :ref:`personal pronoun<pronoun_personal>`,
so context will decide how to understand that word.

Function
--------

Functions as a noun
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First / second mention
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

זֶה is used for items when they are first mentioned.

הוּא is used for items that have already been mentioned.

.. csv-table:: Example: JDG 7:4

  "וְהָיָ֡ה אֲשֶׁר֩ אֹמַ֨ר אֵלֶ֜יךָ \ **זֶ֣ה** ׀ יֵלֵ֣ךְ
     אִתָּ֗ךְ \ **ה֚וּא** יֵלֵ֣ךְ אִתָּ֔ךְ"
  "wehayah 'asher 'omar 'eleykha **zeh** yelekh 'ittakh **hu** yelekh
     'ittakh"
  "And-it-is that I-will-say to-you **this** will-go with-you **that**
     will-go with-you"
  "If I say to you, ""**This one** will go with you,"" **he** will go with
     you"

   הוּא here can be understood and translated as either a demonstrative
   pronoun, or a personal pronoun.

Reciprocal
^^^^^^^^^^

Demonstrative pronouns can be used to distinguish individuals within a
group interacting with each other.

.. csv-table:: Example: ISA 6:3

  וְקָרָ֨א \ **זֶ֤ה** אֶל־זֶה֙
  weqara **zeh** 'el-**zeh**
  And-it-called **this** to\_\ **this**
  And **each one** called to **another**

Apposition to a noun
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a demonstrative pronoun qualifies a person, it is for emphasis or
to draw attention to the presence of that person.

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 27:21

  הַֽאַתָּ֥ה \ **זֶ֛ה** בְּנִ֥י
  ha'attah **zeh** beni
  the-you **this** my-son
  you are my **true** son


Functions as an :ref:`adjective<adjective>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`Attributive<adjective-attributive>` use
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When it is used as an attributive adjective, the demonstrative pronoun
often follows the noun, and both the noun and adjective can have a
:ref:`definite article<particle_definite_article>`.

.. csv-table:: Example: ISA 18:23

  הַדְּבָרִ֖ים הָאֵ֑לֶּה
  haddevarim **ha'elleh**
  the-words **the-these**
  **these** words

Sometimes neither the noun nor the demonstrative pronoun have a definite
article.

.. csv-table:: Example: JOS 2:20

  דְּבָרֵ֣נוּ זֶ֑ה
  devarenu **zeh**
  our-business **this**
  **this** business of ours

.. csv-table:: Example: 1KI 19:5

  וְהִנֵּֽה־\ **זֶ֤ה** מַלְאָךְ֙
  wehinneh-\ **zeh** mal'akh
  And-behold **this** angel
  Suddenly an angel

:ref:`Predicative<adjective-predicate>` use
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. csv-table:: Example: JDG 4:14

  זֶ֤ה הַיּוֹם֙
  **zeh** hayyom
  **this** the-day
  **this** is the day

.. _pronoun_demonstrative-relative:

Functions as a :ref:`relative particle<particle_relative>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. csv-table:: Example: PSA 74:2

  הַר־צִ֝יֹּ֗ון **זֶ֤ה**\ ׀ שָׁכַ֬נְתָּ בֹּֽו׃
  har-tsiyyown **zeh** shakhanta bow
  Mount\_Zion **this** you-lived in-it.
  "Mount Zion, **where** you live."

.. csv-table:: Example: PSA 104:26

  לִ֝וְיָתָ֗ן \ **זֶֽה**\ ־יָצַ֥רְתָּ
  liwyathan **zeh**-yatsarta
  Leviathan **this**\ \_you-formed
  "Leviathan, **which** you formed"

Redundant use
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The demonstrative pronoun does not always need to be translated.

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 47:6

  אֶ֤רֶץ מִצְרַ֙יִם֙ לְפָנֶ֣יךָ הִ֔וא
  'erets mitsrayim lefaneykha **hiw**
  Land-of Egypt to-your-face **that**
  The land of Egypt is before you

The above example may also be translated as "This land of Egypt before you".
