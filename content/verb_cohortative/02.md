# verb_cohortative Article
The cohortative form looks very similar to an imperfect form but functions in the sentence more like an imperative.  Cohortative verbs appear in 1st person forms.  [Similarly, imperatives appear only in 2nd person forms, and jussives usually appear in 3rd person forms.]  **A cohortative verb does not carry the full force of a command ("We *must* do this!"), but it conveys a stronger meaning than a simple suggestion or statement of possibilty ("We *could* do this.").**  The meaning is somewhere in the middle.  In English, a jussive is often translated with a helping verb such as "let" or "want" or "will" – depending on the context (*"Let us do this!"* or *"I want to do this!"*).  Thus, the cohortative verb functions as an indirect command; the reader must examine the context to determine the strength of desirability being expressed in each specific instance.  **NOTE: In Biblical Hebrew, it is possible for the imperfect form to express a cohortative meaning** (see article on Imperfect verbs).

*[Editorial note: How are verbs being tagged where the imperfect form is functioning cohortatively?  Are they being tagged as "cohortative" or "imperfect"?  This makes a difference in how this article should be written.  I have written this as if they are tagged as "imperfect."  But if they are tagged as cohortative, then this section should be slightly altered.]*

**NOTE: The negation particle אַל is always used to express a negative cohortative in Biblical Hebrew, never לֹא.**  Thus, the use of the particle  with a cohortative does not reflect any specific nuance of meaning, as it does with certain imperfect and jussive forms.


The cohortative form can indicate any of the following kinds of actions:

#### 1) Indirect commands

> Deut 13:3 –    "...Let us go after other gods."
 
#### 2) Actions of greater or lesser desirability (requests, invitations, wishes, etc.)

> 2 Sam 19:39 –  וַיֹּ֣אמֶר הַמֶּ֗לֶךְ אִתִּי֙ יַעֲבֹ֣ר כִּמְהָ֔ם  "And the king said, '***Let*** Chimham ***pass over*** with me'..."
> 
> Gen 33:14 –  יַעֲבָר־נָ֥א אֲדֹנִ֖י לִפְנֵ֣י עַבְדּ֑וֹ  "***Let*** my lord ***pass on*** ahead of his servant..."
> 
> 1 Sam 10:24 – וַיֹּאמְר֖וּ יְחִ֥י הַמֶּֽלֶךְ׃ "And they said, '***Long live*** the king!'"
> 

#### 3) Temporary prohibitions (2nd person forms with negation particle אַל)

> Gen 37:22 –  וְיָ֖ד אַל־תִּשְׁלְחוּ־ב֑וֹ  "...but ***do not lay*** a hand upon him..."
