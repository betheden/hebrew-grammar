# stem_hithpael Article

The Hithpael stem is the reflexive form of the Piel [stem](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem/02.md) formation in Biblical Hebrew, usually indicated by a הִתְ prefix and a daghesh in the middle consonant of the [verb](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/verb/02.md). The Hithpael stem is quite flexible in its use in Biblical Hebrew.  Generally speaking, the Hithpael stem expresses the reflexive sense of the meaning of a verb in the Piel stem; but it can also express middle, reciprocal, or even simple action, depending on the context and the specific verb.

NOTE: It is recommended to *always* consult a dictionary or lexicon for the specific meaning of the Hithpael stem for any verb, because the Hithpael stem has potential to express many different kinds of action for various verbs.

## Form

***[insert paradigm]***

## Function

The Hithpael stem can express any of the following kinds of verbal action:

### Expresses the reflexive sense of the Piel stem
For most verbs that appear in both the Piel and Hithpael stems in Biblical Hebrew, the Hithpael stem expresses the same kind of action as the Piel stem (simple, intensive, resultative, causative, etc.) but in its reflexive sense.  A good example is the verb בָּקַע.  In the Qal stem, the verb בָּקַע means "to cut open" or "to break open" (simple action).  But in the Piel stem, the verb בָּקַע means "to *rip* open" (intensive action).  Thus, in the Pual stem, the verb בָּקַע means "to be ripped open" (passive intensive action).

<tr class="row-odd"><td>**and he was buried** in the garden of his house</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>**and he was buried** in the garden of his own house</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Expresses simple reflexive action??
Some verbs use the Hithpael stem to express simple reflexive action (rather than the Niphal stem).  This can be true even if the verb also appears in the Piel stem in Biblical Hebrew; in such cases, the Hithpael form does NOT function as a passive of the Piel stem. A good example is the verb יָלַד.  In the Qal stem, the verb יָלַד expresses the simple action "to give birth".  In the Piel stem, the verb יָלַד expresses the causative action "to cause to give birth" (meaning, *to serve as a midwife*).  But in the Pual stem, the verb יָלַד expresses the simple passive "to be born" (that is, the reflexive of the *Qal* stem rather the *Piel* stem).

<tr class="row-even"><td></td>

<tr class="row-odd"><td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Expresses middle action
Middle action means that the subject receives the action but also is (partially) involved in performing the action.  This kind of action stands somewhere between passive action and reflexive action.

<tr class="row-even"><td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Expresses reciprocal action
Reciprocal action means that multiple subjects are in view who are both performing the action for another and receiving the action from another.  In English, reciprocal action is expressed using the phrase "each other" as the object of the verb, "They tell each other."  In Biblical Hebrew, the reciprocal nature of the action is expressed by the Hithpael form of the verb itself without any additional words.  

Reciprocal action must be distinguished from reflexive action.  The phrase "They tell themselves" is reflexive: the subject "they" is a unified group and the action could be expressed reflexively for each individual as "he tells himself, and he tells himself, and she tells herself, etc."  The phrase "They tell each other" is reciprocal: each member of the group is telling something to another member of the group, and each member of the group is being told something by another member of the group.

</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>Why do you look at each other?</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Why do you look at one another?</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Expresses simple action
In Biblical Hebrew, some verbs express different meanings in different stem formations.  A good example is the Hebrew verb רָאָה.  In the Qal stem, the verb רָאָה expresses the simple action "to seֶe".  But in the Niphal stem, the verb רָאָה expresses the simple action "to appear".  A dictionary or lexicon will indicate the different meanings for these verbs in the various stem formations.

<table border="1" class="docutils">

<tr class="row-even"><td>**wayyera** yehwah 'el-'avram</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>**And he appeared** Yahweh to Abram</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Yahweh **appeared** to Abram,...</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Expresses stative action

In Biblical Hebrew, some verbs express stative action in the *Niphal* stem rather than the *Qal* stem. This is a very rare use of the Niphal stem. Stative action is expressed most often using the Qal stem in Biblical Hebrew. 

* GEN 6:6
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>וַיִּנָּ֣חֶם יְהוָ֔ה כִּֽי־עָשָׂ֥ה אֶת־הָֽאָדָ֖ם בָּאָ֑רֶץ</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>**wayyinnahem** yehwah ki-'asah 'eth-ha'adam ba'arets</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>**And he was sorry** Yahweh that he had made [direct object marker] the humanity on the earth</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Yahweh **regretted** that he had made mankind on the earth,...</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Direct 

The subject does the action to itself; the subject is also the direct object of the verb.

* ISA 8:9
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>הִתְאַזְּרוּ</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>hith'azzeru</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>arm yourselves</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>arm yourselves</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Indirect 

The subject does the action to itself; the subject is also the indirect object of the verb.

* 1SA 18:4
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>וַיִּתְפַּשֵּׁט יְהוֹנָתָן אֶת־הַמְּעִיל</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>wayyithpashet yehonathan 'eth-hamme'il</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>And he took off Jonathan the robe</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Jonathan took off the robe</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

This means he took off the robe from himself

### Benefactive  

The subject does an action on its own behalf.

* 1KI 8:33
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>וְהִתְפַּלְלוּ וְהִתְחַנְּנוּ אֵלֶ֫יךָ</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>wehithpallu wehithhannenu 'eleykha</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>and they pray and seek favor to you</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>they pray, and request forgiveness from you</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Reciprocal

Two or more subjects act toward each other. This is rare. 



### Estimative

The subject presents itself in a certain way that may not be true.

* 2SA 13:5
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>שְׁכַב עַל־מִשְׁכָּבְךָ וְהִתְחָ֑ל</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>shekhav 'al-mishkavkha wehithhal</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>Lie down on your bed and pretend to be sick</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Lie down on your bed and pretend to be sick</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Passive 

Passive can mean either that something changes the subject into a new state or that the subject changes itself into a new state. 

Passive is usually found in later biblical literature.

* PRO 31:30
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>

</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>הִיא הִתְהַלָּל׃</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>hi hithhallal</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>she will be praised.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>she will be praised.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
This could be translated ‘she is made/caused to be praised’ or ‘she makes herself such as to be praised.’
