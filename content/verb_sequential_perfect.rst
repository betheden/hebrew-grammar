Verb Sequential Perfect
=======================

Summary
-------

A verb with sequential suffix conjugation functions generally like a
verb with *prefix conjugation*, but it also connects to some earlier
verb to form either a sequence of time or a sequence of thought.

Article
-------

The Sequential Suffix Conjugation looks very similar to the normal
:ref:`verb_perfect`,
but it is a separate verbal form and must be treated as such. The
Sequential Suffix Conjugation takes the same verbal endings as the
normal Suffix Conjugation but includes the
:ref:`conjunction`
*waw* (וְ "and") as a prefix. A Sequential Suffix Conjugation
:ref:`verb`
does not function like a normal Suffix Conjugation verb. Rather, it
functions more like an :ref:`verb_imperfect` verb, but with
the added sense of being connected to an earlier verb to form a sequence
of time or a sequence of thought in narrative texts. In poetic texts
this verb form can be understood in a variety of other ways as well.
Sequential Suffix Conjugation verbs often appear in a series following a
clause with a Prefix Conjugation verb.

There is a difference between (1) the Sequential Suffix Conjugation, (2)
the :ref:`verb_perfect-suffix-conjugation-copulative`,
and (3) the normal Prefix Conjugation with the conjunction. (1) and (2)
have an identical form, including the vocalization, so the reader must
determine from the context which one is being used in any given
instance. (1) is also different than (3), although they can have similar
meanings. The Sequential Suffix Conjugation ((1) above) forms a sequence
with the verb in the clause before it, but the normal Prefix Conjugation
((3) above) with the conjunction does not.

Function
--------

The sequential suffix conjugation can indicate any one of many different
kinds of actions:

Incomplete actions, in present or future time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. csv-table:: Example: JER 43:12

  וְהִצַּ֣תִּי אֵ֗שׁ בְּבָתֵּי֙ אֱלֹהֵ֣י מִצְרַ֔יִם
  **wehitsatti** 'esh bevottey 'elohe mitsrayim
  **and-I-will-kindle** fire in-houses-of gods-of Egypt
  **Then I will light** a fire in the temples of Egypt's gods.

In poetry it can take on a variety of functions, here it clearly
continues the previous :ref:`verb_imperfect`.
It signals a :ref:`verb_imperfect-frequentive-or-durative-actions`
that is not (never) completed.

.. csv-table:: Example: PSA 90:6

  בַּ֭בֹּקֶר יָצִ֣יץ **וְחָלָ֑ף** לָ֝עֶ֗רֶב יְמוֹלֵ֥ל **וְיָבֵֽשׁ**\ ׃
  babboqer yatsits **wehalaf** la'erev yemolel **weyavesh**
  "in-the-morning it-blossoms **and-it-renews** at-the-evening it-withers
  **and-it-dries**"
  "In the morning it blooms **and grows up**; in the evening it withers
  **and dries up**."

Frequentive or durative actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These may be in past time, present time, future time, or without a
specified timeframe.

.. csv-table:: Example: 1SA 5:7

  וַיִּרְא֥וּ אַנְשֵֽׁי־אַשְׁדּ֖וֹד כִּֽי־כֵ֑ן וְאָמְר֗וּ
  wayyir'u 'anshe-'ashdod ki-khen **we'omru**
  and-they-saw men-of\_Ashdod that\_thus **and-they-were-saying**
  "When the men of Ashdod realized what was happening, **they said**"

Direct or indirect commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following example, the sequential suffix conjugation is
translated with :ref:`verb_imperative` meaning.

.. csv-table:: Example: 2SA 7:5

  לֵ֤ךְ **וְאָֽמַרְתָּ֙** אֶל־עַבְדִּ֣י אֶל־דָּוִ֔ד
  lekh **we'amarta** 'el-'avdi 'el-dawid
  go **and-say** to\_my-servant to\_David
  Go **and tell** David my servant

In the following example, the sequential suffix conjugation is
translated with :ref:`verb_jussive` meaning.

.. csv-table:: Example: GEN 31:44

  וְהָיָ֥ה לְעֵ֖ד בֵּינִ֥י וּבֵינֶֽךָ
  **wehayah** le'ed beni uvenekha
  **and-let-it-be** for-a-witness between-me and-between-you
  **and let it be** for a witness between you and me.

Imaginary, possible, or conditional actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. csv-table:: Example: EXO 21:20

  "וְכִֽי־יַכֶּה֩ אִ֨ישׁ אֶת־עַבְדּ֜וֹ א֤וֹ אֶת־אֲמָתוֹ֙ בַּשֵּׁ֔בֶט
     וּמֵ֖ת"
  wekhi-yakkeh 'ish 'eth-'avdo 'o 'eth-'amatho bashevet **umeth**
  "and-if\_he-strikes man [dir.obj]\_his-servant or
     [dir.obj]\_his-female-servant with-the-rod **and-he-dies**"
  "If a man hits his male servant or his female servant with a staff,
     **and if the servant dies**"

Actions of greater or lesser desirability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These may include instructions, requests, permissions, invitations,
assurances, wishes, etc.

In the following example, the sequential suffix conjugation is
translated with :ref:`verb_cohortative` meaning.

.. csv-table:: Example: RUT 2:7

  אֲלַקֳטָה־נָּא֙ **וְאָסַפְתִּ֣י** בָֽעֳמָרִ֔ים
  'alaqotah-nna' **we'asafti** vo'omarim
  let-me-glean\_oh **and-let-me-gather** among-the-reapers
