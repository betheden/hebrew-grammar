# particle_interrogative Article
## ה can be an interrogative particle when it is a prefix.

* GEN 43:7

    * הֲיֵ֣שׁ לָכֶ֣ם אָ֔ח 

    * Do you have a brother? (literally, Is there to you a brother?)

* 2SA 20:17

    * הַאַתָּ֥ה יוֹאָ֖ב 

    * Are you Joab?

The interrogative particle can be differentiated from the definite article by checking context and also the vowels under the ה. Also, the radical after the ה is not doubled.
