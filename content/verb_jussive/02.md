# verb_jussive Article
The jussive form looks very similar to an imperfect verb but functions in the sentence more like an imperative verb.  Jussive verbs usually appear in 3rd person forms.  [Similarly, imperatives appear only in 2nd person forms, and cohortatives appear only in 1st person forms.]  **A jussive verb does not carry the full force of a command (*"He must do this!"*), but it conveys a stronger meaning than a simple suggestion or statement of possibilty (*"He could do this."*).**  The meaning is somewhere in the middle.  In English, a jussive is often translated with the helping verb "may" or "let," depending on the context (*"May he do this!"* or *"Let him do this!"*).  Thus, the jussive verb functions as an indirect command; the reader must examine the context to determine the strength of desirability being expressed in that specific instance.  **NOTE: In Biblical Hebrew, it is possible for the imperfect form to express a jussive meaning** (see article on Imperfect verbs).

*[Editorial note: How are verbs being tagged where there is no distinct jussive form?  Are they being tagged as "jussive" or "imperfect"?  This makes a difference in how this article should be written.  I have written this as if they are tagged as "imperfect."  But if they are tagged as jussive, then this section should be slightly altered.  Examples in Psa 51:9 and Exo 34:9.]*

Biblical Hebrew does not use the imperative form to express negative commands.  Rather, negative commands are always expressed using either the imperfect form or the jussive form.  In cases where the jussive form is being used to express a negative command, the jussive will appear in a 2nd person form rather than a 3rd person form.  **When used in this way, the jussive form takes the negation particle אַל and expresses a *temporary* prohibition** (as opposed to the imperfect form with the negation particle לֹא which expresses an *absolute* prohibition; see article on Imperfect verbs).


The jussive form can indicate any of the following kinds of actions:

#### 1) Indirect commands

> Gen 1:3 –  יְהִ֣י א֑וֹר  "***Let there be*** light!"

#### 2) Actions of greater or lesser desirability (requests, invitations, wishes, etc.)

> 2 Sam 19:39 –  וַיֹּ֣אמֶר הַמֶּ֗לֶךְ אִתִּי֙ יַעֲבֹ֣ר כִּמְהָ֔ם  "And the king said, '***Let*** Chimham ***pass over*** with me'..."
> 
> Gen 33:14 –  יַעֲבָר־נָ֥א אֲדֹנִ֖י לִפְנֵ֣י עַבְדּ֑וֹ  "***Let*** my lord ***pass on*** ahead of his servant..."
> 
> 1 Sam 10:24 – וַיֹּאמְר֖וּ יְחִ֥י הַמֶּֽלֶךְ׃ "And they said, '***Long live*** the king!'"
> 

#### 3) Temporary prohibitions (2nd person forms with negation particle אַל)

> Gen 37:22 –  וְיָ֖ד אַל־תִּשְׁלְחוּ־ב֑וֹ  "...but ***do not lay*** a hand upon him..."
