# verb_sequential_imperfect Article
The sequential imperfect form looks very similar to the normal imperfect form, but it is a completely separate verbal form and must be treated as such. The sequential imperfect form takes the same verbal endings as the imperfect form but includes as a specialized form of the conjunction as a prefix.  **Thus, there is a difference between the sequential imperfect form and a normal imperfect form with the conjunction.**  A sequential imperfect verb looks very much like a normal imperfect verb, but it does not function that way. Rather, it acts like an *perfect* verb, but with an added sense of progression.  Thus, a sequential imperfect verb is connected to some earlier verb to form a sequence, either a sequence of time or a sequence of thought. In Hebrew narratives, a new sentence usually begins with a sequential imperfect verb.

Generally speaking, the sequential imperfect form is easily distinguished from the normal imperfect form with a conjunction.  In plain terms, the normal imperfect form with a conjunction looks exactly like what one would expect: a normal imperfect form (example) with a conjunction added (example), yielding the resulting form (example).  The sequential imperfect form looks significantly different; it is generally identified by (1) a lengthened vowel (usually pathach) under the conjunction instead of the shewa, and (2) the daghesh in the prefix consonant of the verbal form.  

The sequential perfect form can indicate any one of many different kinds of actions:

#### **1) Future or incomplete actions**
1 Sam 17:32 –  עַבְדְּךָ֣ יֵלֵ֔ךְ וְנִלְחַ֖ם  "...Your servant will go ***and fight***..."


#### **2) Habitual actions**
1 Sam 2:19 –  וּמְעִ֤יל קָטֹן֙ תַּעֲשֶׂה־לּ֣וֹ אִמּ֔וֹ וְהַעַלְתָ֥ה ל֖וֹ מִיָּמִ֣ים  "And his mother would make him a little robe ***and bring*** it to him every year..."


#### **3) Commands or exhortations (similar to imperatives, jussives, or cohortatives)**
2 Sam 15:19 –  שׁ֣וּב וְשֵׁ֤ב עִם־הַמֶּ֙לֶךְ֙  "...Go back ***and stay*** with the king..." [imperative]

Gen 1:15 –  וְהָי֤וּ לִמְאוֹרֹת֙   "***And let them be*** as lights..." [jussive]

Judg 19:13 –  וְנִקְרְבָ֖ה בְּאַחַ֣ד הַמְּקֹמ֑וֹת וְלַ֥נּוּ  "...Now let us draw near to one of these places ***and stay the night***..." [cohortative]


#### **4) Possible actions**
Gen 3:22 –  פֶּן־יִשְׁלַ֣ח יָד֗וֹ וְלָקַח֙  "...lest he should stretch out his hand ***and take***..."  


#### **5) Desirable actions**
1 Kin 8:30 –  וְשָׁ֨מַעְתָּ֜ אֶל־תְּחִנַּ֤ת עַבְדְּךָ֙  "***And hear*** the prayer of your servant..."


#### **6) Conditional actions (and other actions without a specified timeframe)**
Gen 44:22 –  וְעָזַ֥ב אֶת־אָבִ֖יו וָמֵֽת׃  "***And if he should leave*** his father, ***then*** [his father] ***would die***..."
