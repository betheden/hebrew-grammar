# adjective Article
Adjectives always match the noun they describe in gender and number. Because the gender of some nouns does not match their form, the adjective matches the gender of the noun, not its form. If the noun is dual, the adjective will be plural. If a noun is collective or if a plural noun refers to one person, the adjective may match the implied number rather than the form. 

## 1. The adjective describes an attribute if 
-the adjective and the noun are both definite or both indefinite

-the adjective comes after the noun

1SA 18:17 

בתי הגדולה	“my daughter the older” = “my older daughter”

## 2. The adjective is connected to a noun with a linking verb if
-the adjective is indefinite

2SA 14:20

ואדני חכם "and my lord wise” = “and my lord is wise”

Therefore, if the adjective is indefinite and comes after the noun, it is not clear if it describes and attribute or is connected to a noun with a linking verb.

## 3. If there is no noun, the adjective acts like one. 
PSA 3:2

עלי קמים רבים “many are rising up against me” = “many people are rising up against me”

## 4. Compare 2 nouns
To compare two nouns, מן  is used. It can mean “more.”

JDG 14:18

מה-מתוק מדבשׁ ומה עז מארי  “What sweet than honey, and what strong than lion” = “What is sweeter than honey, and what is stronger than a lion”

## 5. Compare 3 or more nouns
-definite

1SA 16:11

הקטן "the young” = “the youngest”

-if the next word has the prefix ב followed by a plural noun

SNG 1:8 

היפה בנשׁים "the fair among women” = “the fairest among women”

-if the noun is in construct. Often the noun may be repeated, first as single, then plural. 

EXO 26:33

קדשׁ הקדשׁים "holy of the holy” = “the holiest place”

## The noun may also have a pronominal suffix
