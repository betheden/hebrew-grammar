# pronoun Article
A pronoun is a word that, like a [noun](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/noun/02.md), refers to a person or a thing, but it does not have any meaning in itself.

## Types
Hebraists usually identify five types of pronouns: [demonstrative](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/pronoun_demonstrative/02.md), [indefinite](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/pronoun_indefinite/02.md), [interrogative](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/pronoun_interrogative/02.md), [personal](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/pronoun_personal/02.md), and [relative](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/pronoun_relative/02.md).
