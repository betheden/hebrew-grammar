Adjectives agree with the gender of the noun they refer to.

The gender of a ** finite verb** works as follows: The gender of the verb agrees with the subject, namely the person or object that does the action or the person or object whose state is described by the verb if the verb is active. If the verb is passive the gender of the verb agrees with the person or the object that undergoes or receives the action (the direct object).






Feminine singular nouns and adjectives usually end in either ה or ת. Feminine dual nouns end in יִִם ַ  . Feminine plural nouns usually end in ות

Exceptions--Some nouns such as אֵם (mother) and אֶרֶץ (earth) have no feminine ending. 

The feminine gender of nouns can show two things:

* Feminine nouns are feminine either because they refer to a female person, or because they are an object whose grammar is feminine. 

* Body parts that are in pairs and proper names of places are often feminine.
