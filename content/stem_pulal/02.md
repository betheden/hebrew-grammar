## Form
The Pulal stem is a variation of the [Pual stem](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_pual/02.md) and expresses the passive voice of the verbal action of the [Pilel stem](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_pilel/02.md) and/or the [Palel stem](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_palel/02.md).  The Pulal stem is formed from the Pual stem by repeating the 3rd radical, thus making a verb that appears to have 4 consonants (with a vowel shift). It is an extremely rare verbal form in Biblical Hebrew. Most of the Pulal verbs found in the Hebrew Bible are from the root אָמַל ("to be weak"). It is recommended to *always* consult a dictionary or lexicon for the precise nuance of any verb in the Pulal stem.
