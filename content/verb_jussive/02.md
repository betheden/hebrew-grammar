# verb_jussive Article
**In Biblical Hebrew, the jussive form looks very similar to an imperfect verb but functions in the sentence more like an imperative verb.  Jussive verbs appear in 3rd person forms.**  [Similarly, imperatives appear only in 2nd person forms, and cohortatives appear only in 1st person forms.]  A jussive verb does not carry the full force of a command (*"He must do this!"*), but it conveys a stronger meaning than a simple suggestion or statement of possibilty (*"He could do this."*).  The meaning is somewhere in the middle.  In English, a jussive is often translated with the helping verb "may" or "let," depending on the context (*"May he do this!"* or *"Let him do this!"*).  Thus, the jussive verb functions as an indirect command; the reader must examine the context to determine the strength of desirability being expressed in that specific instance.  NOTE: In Biblical Hebrew, it is possible for an imperfect verb to have a jussive meaning (see article on Imperfect verbs).



(This is in opposition to the perfect form, which is used to describe either actions that are completed or actions that occur in the past from the perspective of the writer/speaker.)  However, the imperfect form is also used to describe several other kinds of actions as determined by the context, including commands, potential actions/events, and desirable actions/events.  For this reason, **the reader must carefully examine the context of each instance of the imperfect form to ensure that the proper sense of the verb is understood as best as possible.**  This is especially true in Hebrew poetry.

**When the conjunction is added to the imperfect form as a prefix, the meaning is the same as a normal imperfect form with the conjunction.**  This in contrast to the Sequential Imperfect form, which utilizes a specialized form of the conjunction and contains a different meaning.  [See the article on Sequential Imperfect verbs for more information regarding how to identify the sequential perfect form and how it differs in meaning from the normal perfect verb.]

Sometimes the imperfect verb occurs within a clause after another finite verb.  In these cases, the context must determine whether the imperfect verb is complementing the main verb or whether the imperfect verb is communicating its own verbal idea.  There are other times, especially in poetry, when the reader finds an imperfect form in a place where a perfect form is expected.  The context must determine the correct translation in these cases.  **NOTE: for negative commands in Biblical Hebrew, the imperfect form is used with the negation particle לֹא to express an *absolute* prohibition.  In contrast to this, the jussive form is used with the negation particle אַל to express a *temporary* prohibition** (see the article on Jussive verbs).

The imperfect form can indicate any of the following kinds of actions:

#### 1) Future actions, events, or expectations

> Gen 2:17 –  בְּי֛וֹם אֲכָלְךָ֥ מִמֶּ֖נּוּ מ֥וֹת תָּמֽוּת׃  "...in the day you eat from it, surely ***you will die***..."

#### 2) Present actions or events

> Gen 37:15 –  וַיִּשְׁאָלֵ֧הוּ הָאִ֛ישׁ לֵאמֹ֖ר מַה־תְּבַקֵּֽשׁ׃  "And the man asked him, saying, 'What ***are you seeking***?'"

#### 3) Habitual actions (can be past, present, or future time)

> 1 Sam 1:7 –  וְכֵ֨ן יַעֲשֶׂ֜ה שָׁנָ֣ה בְשָׁנָ֗ה  "And this is what ***he was doing*** year by year..."
> 
> Gen 32:33 –  לֹֽא־יֹאכְל֨וּ בְנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֜ל אֶת־גִּ֣יד הַנָּשֶׁ֗ה  "...the Israelites ***do not eat*** the sinew of the hip..."

#### 4) Commands (especially with לֹא to express an absolute prohibition)

> Exo 20:14 –  לֹ֣֖א תִּֿנְאָֽ֑ף׃  "***You shall not commit adultery***."

#### 5) Potential actions or events

> Gen 32:18 –  כִּ֣י יִֽפְגָּשְׁךָ֞ עֵשָׂ֣ו אָחִ֗י  "If Esau my brother ***meets*** you, ...'"

#### 6) Desirable (or undesirable) actions or events

> Lev 19:32 – מִפְּנֵ֤י שֵׂיבָה֙ תָּק֔וּם "...you ***ought to rise*** up before the gray-haired..."

#### 7) Past actions of duration (usually with a temporal marker טֶרֶם or עַד or אָז)

> Gen 41:50 –  וּלְיוֹסֵ֤ף יֻלַּד֙ שְׁנֵ֣י בָנִ֔ים בְּטֶ֥רֶם תָּב֖וֹא שְׁנַ֣ת הָרָעָ֑ב  "And to Joseph were born two sons before the year of the famine ***came***...
> 
> Josh 10:13 –  וַיִּדֹּ֨ם הַשֶּׁ֜מֶשׁ...עַד־יִקֹּ֥ם גּוֹי֙ אֹֽיְבָ֔יו  "And the sun stood still ... until the nation ***took revenge*** on its enemies..."
> 
> 2 Ki 12:18 –  אָ֣ז יַעֲלֶ֗ה חֲזָאֵל֙ מֶ֣לֶךְ אֲרָ֔ם  "At that time Hazael, king of Aram, ***went up***..."
