# verb_imperative Article
In Biblical Hebrew, the imperative form is used to express positive commands or instructions directed to another person(s).  Thus, imperative verbs always appear only in the 2nd person.  [Similarly, cohortatives appear only in the 1st person, and jussives appear usually in the 3rd person.]  Imperative verbs can express actions with varying degrees of desirability, including commands, requests, invitations, or even simple wishes.

Biblical Hebrew does NOT use the imperative form to express negative commands.  Rather, prohibitions are expressed either with an imperfect verb (with negation particle ) or with a jussive verb in the 2nd person (with negation particle ).  Occasionally, the imperative form will appear with a ה suffix.  These have been classified traditionally as emphatic imperatives, but the specific meaning of the ה suffix (when attached to the imperative form) is unknown.

The imperative form can indicate any of the following kinds of actions:

#### Direct commands or instructions

    *  שִֽׂים־נָ֥א יָדְךָ֖ תַּ֥חַת יְרֵכִֽי׃  
    *  **[insert transliteration**]
    *  put [exhortation particle] your hand under my thigh
    *  "Put your hand under my thigh"

#### Actions of greater or lesser desirability (requests, invitations, wishes, etc.)

    *  וַיֹּ֖אמֶר פַּרְעֹ֑ה עֲלֵ֛ה וּקְבֹ֥ר אֶת־אָבִ֖יךָ
