# adjective Article
Adjectives always match the noun they describe in gender and number. Because the gender of some nouns does not match their form, the adjective matches the gender of the noun, not its form. If the noun is dual, the adjective will be plural. If a noun is collective or if a plural noun refers to one person, the adjective may match the implied number rather than the form. 

## Describes an attribute
- If the adjective and the noun are both definite or both indefinite.
- And the adjective comes after the noun.

* 1SA 18:17 
   
    * בִתִּ֨י הַגְּדוֹלָ֤ה
    
    * my older daughter (literally, my daughter the older)

## Connected with a linking verb
- If the adjective is indefinite.

* 2SA 14:20
    
    * וַאדֹנִ֣י חָכָ֗ם  
    
    * and my lord is wise (literally, and my lord wise)

Note: If the adjective is indefinite and comes after the noun, it can either describe an attribute or be connected to a noun with a linking verb.

## Substantive
The adjective functions like a noun.
