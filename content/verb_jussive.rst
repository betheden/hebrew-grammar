Verb Jussive
============

Summary
-------

A jussive verb is used to express indirect commands, direct negative
commands limited by time, and other similar actions with varying degrees
of desirability as determined by the context.

Article
-------

The Jussive form looks very similar to the :ref:`verb_imperfect`
but functions in the sentence more like an
:ref:`verb_imperative`.
Jussive
:ref:`verb`
usually appear in :ref:`person_third`
forms. (Similarly, imperatives appear only in :ref:`person_second`
forms, and :ref:`verb_cohortative` appear only in :ref:`person_first`,
forms.) A Jussive verb does not carry the full force of a command ("He
*must* do this!"), but it conveys a stronger meaning than a simple
suggestion or statement of possibilty ("He *could* do this."). The
meaning is somewhere in the middle. In English, a Jussive is often
translated with the helping verb "may" or "let," depending on the
context ("*May* he do this!" or "*Let* him do this!"). Thus, the Jussive
verb functions as an indirect command; the reader must examine the
context to determine the strength of desirability being expressed in
each specific instance.

Biblical Hebrew does not use the Imperative form to express negative
commands. Rather, negative commands are always expressed using either
the Prefix Conjugation form or the Jussive form. In cases where the
Jussive form is being used to express a negative command, the verb will
appear in a 2nd person form rather than a 3rd person form. When used in
this way, the Jussive form takes the :ref:`particle_negative`
in nearly all instances.
