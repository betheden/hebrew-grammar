# particle Article
Particles are all the words in a language that do not describe or refer to an object or an action, but that are used to describe how the other words in a sentence relate to each other, or where the empahsis in a sentence is. Some Hebrew particles are prefixes that are attached to another word.

Take note: particles and their classifications is subject of much debate (even if we have a pretty good idea what each one means or how it functions). Other parsing systems may have different names for these groups of particles, have different groups, or in individual cases parse a particle as another kind of word like a [noun](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/noun/02.md) or an [adverb](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/adverb/02.md).

## Types
In the parsing system used here there are the following types of particles:

### [Affirmation](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/particle_affirmation/02.md)	
This particle affirms something emphatically. Commonly translated with "yes", or "really".
 
### [Definite article](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/particle_definite_article/02.md)
This is a prefix that will make a word [definite](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/state_determined/02.md) (or determined).
 
### [Demonstrative](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/particle_demonstrative/02.md)	
This particle will draw attention to the reader or the listener to what follows. Commonly translated with "See!", "Look!", or "Behold!"

### [Direct object marker](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/particle_direct_object_marker/02.md)
This particle precedes the direct object in a sentence, especially if there is a possible confusion.

### [Exhortation](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/particle_exhortation/02.md)	
Exhortation particles are used to emphasize a request.

### [Negative](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/particle_negative/02.md)	
These particles are used to negate a [noun](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/noun/02.md) or a [verb](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/verb/02.md).
