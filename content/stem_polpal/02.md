# stem_polpal Article
The Polpal stem is a variation of the [Pual stem](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_pual/02.md) and expresses the passive voice of the verbal action of the [Pilpel stem](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem_pilpel/02.md). The Polpal stem is formed by dropping the 2nd radical and repeating the 1st and 3rd radicals, thus making a verb that appears to have 4 consonants. It is an extremely rare verbal form in Biblical Hebrew.  It is recommended to *always* consult a dictionary or lexicon for the precise nuance of any verb in the Polpal stem.
