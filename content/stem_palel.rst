Article
-------

The Palel stem is a variation of the :ref:`stem_piel`
and has potential to express the same range of verbal action. It is the
same stem formation as the
:ref:`stem_pilel`,
only with a variant vocalization. The Palel stem is formed from the Piel
stem by repeating the 3rd radical (with alternate vowels), thus making a
verb that appears to have 4 consonants. It is an extremely rare verbal
form in Biblical Hebrew. Many of the occurrences of the Palel stem in
the Hebrew Bible are from the root verb שָׁאַן ("to ").
