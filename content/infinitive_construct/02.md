# infinitive_construct Article
The infinitive construct may have a suffixed pronoun. Context will tell if the pronoun is subjective or objective. 

* For example, in JER 2:17 עזבך את-יהוה the pronoun is doing the action, “your abandoning YHWH.” 

* But in RUT 1:16 לעזבל לשוב מאחריך the pronoun is receiving the action, “to abandon you, to turn from following you.”

## Express intention, following ל
This is the most common use.

    * סָ֣ר לִרְא֑וֹת

    * "he turned to see”

## Verbal noun
* 1SA 15:22

    * שְׁמֹ֙עַ֙ מִזֶּ֣בַח ט֔וֹב

## describing an event which is about to happen, following ל
