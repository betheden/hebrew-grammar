Particle Direct Object Marker
=============================

Summary
-------

This particle immediately precedes the term that functions as the direct object of a verb.

Article

As the name suggests, the direct object marker indicates the direct object of some verb. It does this by directly preceding
the :ref:`noun<noun>` or phrase that functions as the direct object of a :ref:`verb<verb>` (either :ref:`finite<verb-finite>` or
:ref:`non-finite<verb-non-finite>`). The direct object marker does not occur before *every* direct object, but it usually appears
in places where there might be confusion. Thus, the direct object marker is not strictly necessary in Biblical Hebrew. Many
languages, including English, do not have any specific word or symbol that serves a similar function; instead, those languages
use other means of indicating the direct object of a verb (such as word order). Therefore, in many translations this particle
is never translated.

The standard form of the direct object marker is אֵת. It can take both the prefixed :ref:`conjunction<conjunction>`
and/or a :ref:`pronominal suffix<suffix_pronominal>`.

.. note:: The direct object marker is easily confused with the preposition
          אֵת ("with") which has an identical standard form. When taking a
          pronominal suffix, however, the two words can be distinguished by the
          vowel they each select. The direct object marker takes a holem or holem-waw
          vowel with an attached suffix (אוֹתִי or אֹתִי), whereas the preposition
          takes a hireq vowel (אִתִּי) with an attached suffix.
