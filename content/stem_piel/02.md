# stem_piel Article

The Piel stem is a verbal [stem](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem/02.md) formation in Biblical Hebrew, usually indicated by a daghesh in the middle consonsant of the [verb](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/verb/02.md). The Piel stem is the most flexible in its use of all the stem formations in Biblical Hebrew and has potential to express many different kinds of verbal action.  These include simple action, intensive action, resultative action, causative action, or other kinds of action depending on the context and the specific verb.  Some verbs express simple action in the Piel stem; some verbs express intensive action in the Piel stem; for some verbs, the Piel stem might express either simple action or intensive action, depending on the context; and so on.

NOTE: It is recommended to *always* consult a dictionary or lexicon for the specific meaning of the Piel stem for any verb, because the Piel stem expresses different kinds of action for various verbs.

### Form

**[paradigm]**

### Function

The Piel stem can express any of the following kinds of verbal action:
 
#### Expresses simple action
In Biblical Hebrew, some verbs can express different meanings in different stem formations.  A good example is the Hebrew verb נָחַם.  In the Niphal stem, the verb נָחַם usually expresses either stative action (to be sorry) or passive action (to be comforted).  But in the Piel stem, the verb נָחַם expresses the simple action "to comfort".  A dictionary or lexicon will indicate the different meanings for these verbs in the various stem formations.

</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>for **you have comforted** me</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>...for **you have comforted** me,...</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

#### Expresses intensive action
Intensive action means that the verbal action is strengthened in some way. A good example is the Hebrew verb שָׁבַר.  In the Qal stem, the verb שָׁבַר means "to break". But in the Piel stem, the verb שָׁבַר means "to shatter" or "to break in pieces". A dictionary or lexicon will indicate an intensive nuance in comparison with the meaning of the verb in other stem formations.

<tr class="row-odd"><td>their altars you break down and their pillars **you shatter**</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>...you must break down their altars, **smash** their stone pillars,...</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

#### Expresses resultative action
Resultative action means that the primary focus of the verb is on the result of the verbal action.  A good example is the verb שָׁלַח.  In the Qal stem, the verb שָׁלַח means "to send" or "to stretch out".  In the Piel stem, the verb שָׁלַח means "to send away".

</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>He gave her the boy and **sent her away**.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

#### Expresses causative action
Causative action means that the subject of the verb is causing the object of the verb either to perform the verbal action (dynamic verbs) or to be in the state described by the verb (stative verbs).  The Piel stem often serves this causative function with stative verbs.  A good example in the verb מָלֵא.  In the Qal stem, the verb מָלֵא expresses the simple action of "to be full".  But in the Piel stem, the verb מָלֵא means "to fill" (meaning, *to cause something to be full*). In English, causative action is expressed using the main verb "cause" with the infinitive of the verbal action in view.  In Biblical Hebrew, the causative sense of the verbal action is expressed by the Piel form of the verb itself with no additional verbal element. Causative action must be expressed by a transitive verb, but non-causative action can be expressed by an intransitive verb.  Thus, a verb that is intransitive in the Qal stem may become transitive in the Piel stem.

#### Expresses various other kinds of verbal action
Sometimes the Piel form is used in ways that do not follow the general conventions of the Piel stem formation as listed above. In these instances, the context demonstrates that none of the normal meanings of the verbal action make sense. A dictionary or lexicon will indicate the correct meaning in these rare instances of the Piel stem. 

* ISA 10:1 –– the Piel form of the verb כָּתַב has uncertain meaning, but seems to indicate *a specific kind* of writing

</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>woe tho ones who enact laws of iniquity **and writers** oppression **they write**</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Woe to those who enact unjust laws **and write** unfair **decrees**.</td>
</tr>

* NUM 19:19 –– the verb חָטָא means "to sin" in the Qal stem, but ִin the Piel stem it means "to purify"
