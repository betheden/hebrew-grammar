Preposition Definite Article
============================

Summary
-------

A preposition is a word that describes the relationship of a noun (or
word that functions as a noun) to another word/concept in the sentence.
In Biblical Hebrew, prepositions can also be used with an infinitive
construct verb to show its relationship to the main verb of a sentence.

Article
-------

Biblical Hebrew has four main prepositions: the prefix בְּ (in, at, by);
the prefix לְ (to, for); the prefix כְּ (as, like); and the prefix מִ
(which is a shortened form of the independent preposition מִן, meaning
"from"). However, there is also a family of other prepositions in
Biblical Hebrew. It is common in Biblical Hebrew for prepositions to be
combined together or with a noun to form new words that have their own
range of meanings (similar to compound
:ref:`conjunction`)
that may or may not overlap with the meaning of the individual component
terms.

In Biblical Hebrew, prepositions also have a specialized function of
describing the relationship between a verbal complement (infinitive
construct or participle) and the main verb of a sentence. In some of
these instances, the preposition introduces a dependent verbal clauses
and thus changes its typical meaning. These specialized uses of
prepositions are listed in the article on :ref:`infinitive_construct`
verbs.

.. note:: Of all the different kinds of words, prepositions are perhaps the
          most flexible in their meaning and are often translated in a variety of
          ways, or sometimes even left untranslated. For this reason, prepositions
          must always be translated with great sensitivity to the context of each
          use. A dictionary or lexicon will describe the various possible meanings
          of each preposition, but generally will not include a complete list of
          individual usages.
