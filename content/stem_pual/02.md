# stem_pual Article
The Pual [stem](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/stem/02.md) is the passive form of the Piel stem formation in Biblical Hebrew.  The Pual stem is usually indicated by a daghesh in the middle consonsant of the [verb](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/verb/02.md) and a qibbuts vowel under the initial consonant. Generally speaking, the Pual stem expresses the passive sense of the meaning of a verb in the Piel stem.  Scholars sometimes disagree whether certain verb forms should be classified as belonging to the Pual stem or the Qal Passive stem.  In English, passive action is expressed using the helping verb "to be." In Biblical Hebrew, the passive nature of the verbal action is expressed by the Pual form of the verb itself without any helping verbs.

NOTE: It is recommended to *always* consult a dictionary or lexicon for the specific meaning of the Pual stem for any specific verb, because the Pual stem has potential to express many different kinds of action for various verbs in different contexts.

### Form

**[paradigm]**

### Function

The Pual stem can express any of the following kinds of verbal action:
 
#### Expresses the passive sense of the Piel stem
For most verbs that appear in both the Piel and Pual stems in Biblical Hebrew, the Pual stem will express the same kind of action as the Piel stem (simple, intensive, resultative, causative, etc.) but in its passive sense.  A good example is the verb בָּקַע.  In the Qal stem, the verb בָּקַע means "to cut open" or "to break open".  But in the Piel stem, the verb בָּקַע means "to rip open" (intensive action).  Thus, in the Pual stem, the verb בָּקַע means "to be ripped open" (passive intensive action).  

* JOS 9:4 –– Pual stem of בָּקַע, meaning "to be ripped open"; in Piel stem, means "to rip open"

<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>וַיִּקְח֞וּ ... וְנֹאד֥וֹת יַ֙יִן֙ בָּלִ֔ים וּמְבֻקָּעִ֖ים וּמְצֹרָרִֽים</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>and they took ... and skins of wine worn-out **and being ripped open** and being mended</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>They also took old wine skins that were worn, **torn**, and had been repaired.</td>
</tr>

* EZK 38:12 –– Pual stem of אָסַף, meaning "to be gathered"; in Piel stem, means "to gather"
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>וְאֶל־עַם֙ מְאֻסָּ֣ף מִגּוֹיִ֔ם</td>

<tr class="row-even"><td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>and to people **being gathered** from nations</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>...and against the people **gathered** from the nations,...</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

#### Expresses simple passive action
Some verbs use the Pual stem to express simple passive action (rather than the Niphal stem).  This can be true even if the verb also appears in the Piel stem in Biblical Hebrew; in such cases, the Pual form does NOT function as a passive of the Piel stem. A good example is the verb יָלַד.  In the Qal stem, the verb יָלַד expresses the simple action "to give birth".  In the Piel stem, the verb יָלַד expresses the causative action "to cause to give birth" (meaning, to serve as a midwife).  But in the Pual stem, the verb יָלַד expresses the simple passive "to be born" (that is, the passive of the *Qal* stem rather the *Piel* stem).

* GEN 4:26 –– the Pual form of יָלַד ("to give birth") means "to be born"
<table border="1" class="docutils">

<tr class="row-even"><td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>and to Seth, even him, **he was born** a son</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>A son **was born** to Seth...</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


#### Expresses various kinds of passive or stative action
Sometimes the Pual form is used with specific verbs or in specific contexts to express a specialized meaning for the verbal action. In these instances, the context demonstrates that none of the normal meanings of the verbal action make sense. A dictionary or lexicon will indicate the correct meaning in these instances of the Pual stem.

* EXO 3:2 –– in the Pual stem, the verb אָכַל ("to eat") means "to be consumed" by fire ֹor sword

<tr class="row-even"><td>wehinneh hasseneh bo'er ba'esh wehasseneh 'enennu 'ukkal</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>and behold, the bush was burning in the fire and the bush was not **being consumed**</td>
