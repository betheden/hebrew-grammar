Add: Nouns are either masculine or feminine, and the form of the noun often, but not always indicates which one it is.

Every noun also has a number (singular, plural, or dual), and a state (construct or absolute), the dictionary form is singular absolute. They can also take a variety of prefixes and suffixes that give extra information.

Sometimes an adjective or a verb (especially infinitives and participles) can function like a noun.

In Hebrew, nouns do not change their form based on the function (or case) they have in a sentence (subject/nominative, direct object/accusative, etc.).
