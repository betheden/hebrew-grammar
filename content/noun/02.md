Every noun also has a number, which can be [singular](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/number_singular/02.md), [plural](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/number_plural/02.md), or [dual](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/number_dual/02.md). It also has a state, which can be [construct](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/state_construct/02.md) or [absolute](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/state_absolute/02.md). The dictionary form is singular absolute. Nouns can also have a variety of prefixes and [suffixes](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/suffix/02.md) that give extra information.

The form of the noun often, but not always, indicates its gender, which can be [masculine ](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/gender_masculine/02.md) or [feminine](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/gender_feminine/02.md).

Sometimes an [adjective](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/adjective/02.md#substantive) or a [verb](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/verb/02.md#verbal-nouns) can function like a noun.

In Hebrew, nouns do not change their form based on the function (or case) they have in a sentence (subject/nominative, direct object/accusative, etc.). They only change if they are in [construct state](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/state_construct/02.md).
