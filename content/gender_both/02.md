# gender_both Article
Some nouns appear in both a [masculine](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/gender_masculine/02.md) and a [feminine](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-uhg/src/master/content/gender_feminine/02.md) form. Sometimes their own form is different, in other cases it is clear from the surrounding words (like the verbs) that make clear which gender it is in a particular context.  Words classified as "both gender" are usually nouns or adjectives.

## Examples

* GEN 1:3
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd" align="right"><td>וַיֹּ֥אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֖ים יְהִ֣י **אֹ֑ור** וַֽיְהִי־**אֹֽור**׃</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>wayyomer 'elohim yehi **'owr** wayehi-**'owr**</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>And-he-said God there-will-be **light** and-there-was_**light**.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>God said, "Let there be **light**," and there was **light**.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
The word "light" has a masculine form, and the verbs וַֽיְהִי "let there be" and יְהִ֣י "and there was" are also masculine.

* EST 8:16
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd" align="right"><td>לַיְּהוּדִ֕ים הָֽיְתָ֥ה <b>אֹורָ֖ה</b></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>layyehudim hayethah **'owrah**</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>To-the-Jews there-was **light**</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>The Jews had **light**</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
The word "light" has a feminine form, and the verb הָֽיְתָ֥ה "there was" or "had" is also feminine.

**[Editorial note (Joel): There are some nouns in Biblical Hebrew that appear in both masculine and feminine forms.  The Hebrew words for "light" (אוֹר) and "luminary" (מָאוֹר) are both good examples.  In Gen. 1:3-5, the word אוֹר is masculine; but in Esther 8:16, the word אוֹר is feminine (אוֹרָה).  In Gen. 1:14-19, the word מָאוֹר is feminine plural; but in Ezek 32:7-8, the word מָאוֹר is masculine plural.  So "gender common" means that the word has potential to refer to *either* a masculine *or* feminine referent (and thus take either masculine or feminine grammatical marking).  But "gender both" means that one and the same object is *both* grammatically masculine *and* grammatically feminine in various instances within the Biblical Hebrew text.  They are different phenomena, and should be parsed differently.]**
